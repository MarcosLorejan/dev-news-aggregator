The compromises all stem from a core developers NPM account getting taken over from a phishing campaign

The malware itself, luckily, looks like its mostly intrested in crypto at the moment so its impact is smaller than if they had installed a backdoor for example.

# How the Malware Works (Step by Step)

1. **Injects itself into the browser**
   * Hooks core functions like¬†`fetch`,¬†`XMLHttpRequest`, and wallet APIs (`window.ethereum`, Solana, etc.).
   * Ensures it can intercept both web traffic and wallet activity.
2. **Watches for sensitive data**
   * Scans network responses and transaction payloads for anything that looks like a wallet address or transfer.
   * Recognizes multiple formats across Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana, Tron, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash.
3. **Rewrites the targets**
   * Replaces the legitimate destination with an attacker-controlled address.
   * Uses ‚Äúlookalike‚Äù addresses (via string-matching) to make swaps less obvious.
4. **Hijacks transactions before they‚Äôre signed**
   * Alters Ethereum and Solana transaction parameters (e.g., recipients, approvals, allowances).
   * Even if the UI looks correct, the signed transaction routes funds to the attacker.
5. **Stays stealthy**
   * If a crypto wallet is detected, it avoids obvious swaps in the UI to reduce suspicion.
   * Keeps silent hooks running in the background to capture and alter real transactions

**tldr;** clanker digs through your listening history, asks you a few pointed questions and responds to your answers, and then delivers a roast you didn‚Äôt ask for but probably deserve, with exportable cards for sharing on social media.

some of you might remember pudding.cool''s spotify roast bot that they made back in 2021 (pre-genai which is crazy), which i remember being really fun. so mainly inspired by that (and last.fm''s neighbors feature), i decided to use the gemini api for actual ai roasts and combine both of them into one website. (this is my first proper full stack project btw so forgive me if anything breaks üò≠)

**some features:**

* **scanning recents**: clanker looks through and roasts your recent played music, while processing the rest of the data in the background.
* **interactive q&amp;a**: 6 multiple-choice questions based on your own data¬†
* **final roast**: metrics like variety score, basicness index, listening patterns and a paragraph like verdict to make you question your existence.
* **neighbor search**: weighted jaccard algorithm compares your top artists, tracks, and genres to other users
* **dashboard:** terminal-style dashboard with your top artists, tracks, and genres, and links to neighbors and roast pages.
* a light and dark mode toggle and fully responsive design

**tech stack:**

* next.js with nextauth for frontend/backend
* spotify &amp; gemini/openai api''s for the data and ai roast
* tailwind and framer-motion for styling &amp; animations
* supabase for database &amp; deployed on vercel

i''d love any and every feedback on the experience, the ui, and any problems (and also whether the roast feels personal enough). i''m especially curious how it runs for people with more mainstream vs niche listening habits. (cause ive only tested it on myself and a friend, the rest of the users on the site rn are mock users üò≠) tysm if you try it and add a user to the database!!

I''ve been programming for a couple of decades but love making music for films, so I''ve always made my portfolio website for composing as a bit of a fun passion project where I get to experiment with web technologies. 

Some key points:

* React (Typescript) app
* Serverless architecture using AWS (Lambda, DynamoDB, SES, S3, CloudFront, Cognito) 
* It uses Webiny CMS to manage the API, file management, IaC, and page building
* Tailwind CSS, Embla Carousel
* Web Audio API for FFT analysis that animates that flat surface background
* Cloudflare caching and security hardening

The short backstory is that I used to have a very similar website about 10 years ago that I built with PHP and jQuery but it relied on the Soundcloud API for hosting the music. When their API died, so did my portfolio site. It''s taken me this long to restore it to its former glory without relying on any third-party service. I''ve also saved 95% on hosting costs by switching to serverless.

What makes it interesting:

* 100% browser-based, works on both desktop &amp; mobile

What is this solving?  
If you try to access APIs directly from the client JavaScript, you most likely get a CORS error. This solves it by relaying your request and returning it with the proper CORS headers.

How is this secure?  
I covered this in the repo FAQ, but the gist is: no logging, secure against SSRF and LFI, support handling API keys, and no leaking cookies (credentials).

Major improvements in 2.0:

* Fixed AbortSignal.any fallback that was ignoring user signals
* Manual timeout implementation removes AbortSignal.timeout dependency
* Proper signal composition for complex abort scenarios
* transformRequest hook now preserves signals correctly
* Revamped documentation

The signal handling was surprisingly tricky - combining user AbortSignals with timeout signals while maintaining compatibility across environments. Had to implement manual fallbacks for AbortSignal.any since it''s not available everywhere.

Example of the signal composition in action:

    const controller = new AbortController()
    const client = createClient({ timeout: 5000 })
    
    // Both user signal AND timeout signal work together
    client(''/api/data'', { signal: controller.signal })

Still zero deps, \~2KB, drop-in fetch replacement. The goal was to make fetch() reliable without changing its behavior.

I write a tech blog and I need to create lots of diagrams for it. I like using Mermaid, but I quickly ran into the same frustrating pattern with most of the existing editors and renderers: the free options were either too limited or came with barriers that slowed me down. I wanted something simple: just open the page, paste/type in Mermaid code, preview the diagram, and export it without worrying about limits or accounts.

Here are some concrete problems I ran into with other tools:

\- Mermaid Live Editor (the official one): Great for quick editing, but exporting diagrams is capped by a rate limit on their free tier. After a handful of exports, I‚Äôd get the dreaded ‚Äúfree tier limit exceeded‚Äù message.

Kroki.io: Supports rendering, but running it online requires trusting a shared service with my diagrams. Hosting it myself means extra setup, Docker, and server resources ‚Äî not ideal if I just want to save a few diagrams.

\- Excalidraw &amp; Lucidchart: Both have nice UIs, but they‚Äôre general diagramming tools, not native Mermaid editors. Lucidchart especially locks useful features (like unlimited diagrams or high-quality export) behind a paid plan.

\- Other browser-based tools Almost all I tried had some kind of paywall, signup requirement, or watermark on exports. For something as text-based and simple as Mermaid, that felt unnecessary.

So I built my own tool with a few core principles:

\- No limits: you can create, edit, and export as many diagrams as you want.

\- No signup: the tool works straight from the browser, nothing to install.

\- No tracking: privacy-friendly, just you and your diagrams.

\- Open source: [https://github.com/gkoos/mermaid-editor](https://github.com/gkoos/mermaid-editor)

So you can write something like

    const imagePreview = preview(''https://example.com/image.jpg'');
    
    // or
    
    const Image = (
      &lt;img
        src={preview(''https://example.com/image.jpg'')}
        data-src="https://example.com/image.jpg"
      /&gt;
    )

And it gets converted to

    const imagePreview = ''data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoA...''
    
    // or
    
    const Image = (
      &lt;img
        src={''data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoA...''}
        data-src="https://example.com/image.jpg"
      /&gt;
    )

Pair it with a lazy loading library to avoid layout shifts as your images load.

On server side (Astro / NextJS, etc.) you won''t need the bundler integration and can directly generate previews by calling the `getPlaceholder` function.

# The Problem

I needed word-by-word and letter-by-letter animations for a client project. AOS.js and SAL.js are great, but they don''t handle text splitting well, and most libraries don''t support web components.

# What I Built

* **9KB minified** (smaller than most images) (5KB Gzipped)
* **40+ animations** (fade, zoom, flip with all directions)
* **Text animations** (split by word/letter, shimmer effects, counters)
* **Framework packages** for React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, Lit
* **Web Components support** (rare in animation libs)
* **Zero dependencies**

# Quick Examples

**Basic usage:**

    &lt;script src="https://cdn.usal.dev/latest"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;div data-usal="fade-u duration-800"&gt;Fades up smoothly&lt;/div&gt;

**Text animations:**

    &lt;p data-usal="split-word split-fade-r split-delay-200"&gt;
      Each word appears from right
    &lt;/p&gt;

**Number counters:**

    &lt;span data-usal="count-[1234] duration-2000"&gt;1234&lt;/span&gt;

**React integration:**

    npm install /react
    
    import { USALProvider } from ''@usal/react'';
    
    &lt;USALProvider&gt;
      &lt;h1 data-usal="fade-u"&gt;Animated in React&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;/USALProvider&gt;

# Why Another Animation Library?

* **Tailwind-inspired syntax** (duration-800, delay-200)
* **Text-first approach** (word/letter splitting built-in)
* **True framework agnostic** (even supports Web Components)
* **Performance focused** (60fps with hundreds of elements)

I started with SAL.js as inspiration but ended up rewriting everything from scratch to get the text animations and framework support I wanted.
