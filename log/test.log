For a long time, our platform had a mildy-frustrating query builder. In the early days, we had separate interfaces for logs, traces, and metrics, which led to a fragmented experience. Our next attempt to unify it with a SQL-based UI was fundamentally flawed, especially for logs, as it couldn't handle complex boolean logic or parentheses.\n\nAfter 2 years of accumulating issues and user feedback, we realized we had to completely overhaul our approach. A key lesson for us was that no matter how technically \"obvious\" a feature seems, if it isn't discoverable, it's useless. We also learned not to make assumptions on behalf of users, as it only leads to a frustrating and surprising experience.\n\nThis led to Query Builder V5, a full architectural rewrite that not only fixed the core issues but also allowed us to pay off a lot of UX debt. It was a humbling journey, but the result is a tool that allows for complex searching and is so intuitive that some users have voluntarily replaced their raw ClickHouse SQL queries with it :) yay"], ["external_id", "1nddp6e"], ["source_type", "reddit_programming"], ["score", 3], ["comment_count", 1], ["created_at", "2025-09-10 15:04:23.425088"], ["updated_at", "2025-09-10 15:04:23.425088"]]

My goal was to create a lean alternative to traditional, resource-heavy PDF solutions.\n\n# Core Technical Design\n\nThe core of the service is built on **Go 1.23+** and the **Gin framework** for their high performance and concurrency capabilities. Unlike many other services that rely on disk-based processing, GoPdfSuit is a **high-performance in-memory PDF generator**. This approach is crucial to its speed, as it completely bypasses slow disk I/O operations, leading to ultra-fast response times of sub-millisecond to low-millisecond.\n\nFor the actual HTML-to-PDF and HTML-to-image conversions, the service leverages the power of `wkhtmltopdf` and `wkhtmltoimage`. This allows it to accurately render web pages and HTML snippets into high-quality PDFs and images. The project demonstrates how intelligently integrating and managing a powerful external tool like `wkhtmltopdf` can lead to a highly optimized and performant solution.\n\n# Key Features and Implementation Details\n\n* **Template-Driven System**: GoPdfSuit utilizes a **JSON-driven templating system**. This design separates data from presentation, making it simple to generate complex, dynamic PDFs by just sending a JSON payload to the REST API.\n* **Flexible PDF Generation**: The service supports multi-page documents with automatic page breaks and custom page sizes, giving developers a high degree of control over the output. It also includes support for **AcroForm** and **XFDF data**, enabling the filling out of interactive forms programmatically.\n* **Deployment**: It's deployed as a single, statically compiled binary, making it extremely easy to get up and running in any environment, from a local machine to a containerized cloud deployment.\n\nI'm happy to discuss the implementation details, the challenges of orchestrating `wkhtmltopdf` in a high-concurrency environment, or the design of the in-memory processing pipeline.\n\n* **GitHub**: [`https://github.com/chinmay-sawant/gopdfsuit`](https://github.com/chinmay-sawant/gopdfsuit)\n* **Project Page**: [`https://chinmay-sawant.github.io/gopdfsuit/`](https://chinmay-sawant.github.io/gopdfsuit/)"], ["external_id", "1ncl9ws"], ["source_type", "reddit_programming"], ["score", 2], ["comment_count", 6], ["created_at", "2025-09-10 15:04:23.468719"], ["updated_at", "2025-09-10 15:04:23.468719"]]

The idea is to keep the server response SEO and accessibility friendly from the start, since it already contains all the data (even async parts) in the initial stream, while still letting you enrich chunks dynamically as they flow.\n\nThere’s a small [live demo](https://htms.skarab42.dev) powered by a tiny zero-install server (`htms-server`), and more examples in the repo if you want to try it yourself.\n\nIt’s very early, so I’d love feedback: break it, test weird cases, suggest improvements… anything goes.\n\n# Packages\n\nThis project contains multiple packages:\n\n* [**htms-js**](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/packages/htms-js) – Core library to tokenize, resolve, and stream HTML.\n* [**fastify-htms**](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/packages/fastify-htms) – Fastify plugin that wires `htms-js` into Fastify routes.\n* [**htms-server**](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/packages/htms-server) – CLI to quickly spin up a server and test streaming HTML.\n\n# 🚀 Quick start\n\n# 1. Install\n\nUse your preferred package manager to install the plugin:\n\n    pnpm add htms-js\n\n# 2. HTML with placeholders\n\n    &lt;!-- home-page.html --&gt;\n    &lt;!doctype html&gt;\n    &lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n      &lt;body&gt;\n        &lt;h1&gt;News feed&lt;/h1&gt;\n        &lt;div data-htms=\"loadNews\"&gt;Loading news…&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n        &lt;h1&gt;User profile&lt;/h1&gt;\n        &lt;div data-htms=\"loadProfile\"&gt;Loading profile…&lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;/body&gt;\n    &lt;/html&gt;\n\n# 3. Async tasks\n\n    // home-page.js\n    export async function loadNews() {\n      await new Promise((r) =&gt; setTimeout(r, 100));\n      return `&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Breaking story&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another headline&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;`;\n    }\n    \n    export async function loadProfile() {\n      await new Promise((r) =&gt; setTimeout(r, 200));\n      return `&lt;div class=\"profile\"&gt;Hello, user!&lt;/div&gt;`;\n    }\n\n# 4. Stream it (Express)\n\n    import { Writable } from 'node:stream';\n    import Express from 'express';\n    import { createHtmsFileModulePipeline } from 'htms-js';\n    \n    const app = Express();\n    \n    app.get('/', async (_req, res) =&gt; {\n      res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html; charset=utf-8');\n      await createHtmsFileModulePipeline('./home-page.html').pipeTo(Writable.toWeb(res));\n    });\n    \n    app.listen(3000);\n\nVisit `http://localhost:3000`: content renders immediately, then fills itself in.\n\n&gt;**Note:** By default, `createHtmsFileModulePipeline('./home-page.html')` resolves `./home-page.js`. To use a different file or your own [resolver](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/packages/htms-js#custom-resolvers), see [API](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/packages/htms-js#api).\n\n# Examples\n\n* [Express](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/examples/express/index.ts), [Fastify](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/examples/fastify/index.ts), [Hono](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/examples/hono/index.ts)\n* [Raw streaming](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/examples/stdout/index.ts) (stdout)\n* [htms server](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/examples/server) (cli)\n\n&amp;#8203;\n\n    git clone https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js.git\n    cd htms-js\n    pnpm i &amp;&amp; pnpm build\n    \n    pnpm --filter (express|fastify|hono|stdout|server)-example start\n\n# How it works\n\n1. **Tokenizer:** scans HTML for `data-htms`.\n2. **Resolver:** maps names to async functions.\n3. **Serializer:** streams HTML and emits chunks as tasks finish.\n4. **Client runtime:** swaps placeholders and cleans up markers.\n\nResult: **SEO-friendly streaming HTML** with minimal overhead."], ["external_id", "1nci9sw"], ["source_type", "reddit_javascript"], ["score", 3], ["comment_count", 3], ["created_at", "2025-09-10 15:04:24.951219"], ["updated_at", "2025-09-10 15:04:24.951219"]]

It was a pretty intense process.\n\n**The Benchmark by the Numbers:**\n\n* **Total Requests:** 10,086\n* **Total Tokens Processed:** 20,021,757\n* **Total Cost:** \\~$45\n* **Models Tested:** 9 (including GPTs, Gemini, Claude, etc.)\n* **Unique Tests:** 249 (each run up to 3 times for consistency)\n\n**A Quick TL;DR of the Findings:** The most interesting result is how dominant `deepseek-chat` is in terms of cost-benefit. Some of the newer, more expensive models still don't quite justify their price for these practical tasks.\n\nMy goal is to provide transparent, unbiased data to help us all build better AI-powered products with more confidence. The entire project is open-source.\n\nYou can dive into all the charts and data yourself here:\n\n📈 **Full Benchmark:**[https://activegenie.ai/benchmark/latest.html](https://activegenie.ai/benchmark/latest.html)  \n👨‍💻 **GitHub Repo (Stars appreciated!):**[https://github.com/Roriz/active\\_genie](https://github.com/Roriz/active_genie)\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts.

Everything you need to focus on building your next mobile, web or desktop application with fewer moving parts. Sub-millisecond latencies completely eliminate the need for dedicated caches - nor more stale or inconsistent data.\n\nJust released v0.17. Some of the highlights from last month include:\n\n* A WASM runtime for strict state isolation, higher-performance endpoints, multiple guest languages, ...check out our [article](https://trailbase.io/blog/switching_to_a_wasm_runtime).\n* A new experimental API for transactional/bulk record mutations.\n* Quicker stream startup for realtime change notifications\n* Admin UI and auth improvements: cleaner settings UI, signed-out change-email verification, email templates, ... \n* Many more small fixes and improvements\n\nCheck out the [live demo](http://demo.trailbase.io), our [GitHub](https://github.com/trailbaseio/trailbase) or our [website](http://trailbase.io).

Back in the early days platforms like Reddit and Twitter were Altman's jam because the buzz around GPT was all sunshine and rainbows. Devs geeking out over prompts, everyone hyping up the next big thing in AI. But oh boy, post-ChatGPT5 launch? It's like the floodgates opened. \n\nSubs are exploding with users calling out real issues. Persistent hallucinations even in ‘advanced’ models, shady data practices at OpenAI.

Nah that's just sound of actual users pushing back when the product doesn't deliver on the god tier promises.\n\nIf anything, this shift shows how ai discourse has matured. From blind hype to informed critique. Bots might be part of the noise sure, but blaming that ignores legit frustration from folks who've sunk hours into debugging flawed outputs or dealing with ethical lapses. \n\nWhat do you all think?

After running 50 tournaments, I’ve published the first results here:\n\n👉 Leaderboard: [https://valyriantech.github.io/ValyrianGamesLeaderboard](https://valyriantech.github.io/ValyrianGamesLeaderboard)\n\n👉 Challenge data repo: [https://github.com/ValyrianTech/ValyrianGamesCodingChallenge](https://github.com/ValyrianTech/ValyrianGamesCodingChallenge)\n\nHow it works:\n\nPhase 1 doubles as qualification: each model must create its own coding challenge, then solve it multiple times to prove it’s fair. To do this, the LLM has access to an MCP server to execute Python code. The coding challenge can be anything, as long as the final answer is a single integer value (for easy verification).\n\nOnly models that pass this step qualify for tournaments.\n\nPhase 2 is the tournament: qualified models solve each other’s challenges head-to-head. Results are scored (+1 correct, -1 wrong, +1 bonus for solving another's challenge, extra penalties if you fail your own challenge).\n\nRatings use Microsoft’s TrueSkill system, which accounts for uncertainty.\n\nSome results so far:\n\nI’ve tested 62 models, but only 18 qualified.\n\nGPT-5-mini is currently #1, but the full GPT-5 actually failed qualification.\n\nSome reasoning-optimized models literally “overthink” until they timeout.\n\nPerformance is multi-dimensional: correctness, speed, and cost all vary wildly.\n\nWhy I built this:\n\nThis started as a testbed for workflows in my own project SERENDIPITY, which is built on a framework I also developed: [https://github.com/ValyrianTech/ValyrianSpellbook](https://github.com/ValyrianTech/ValyrianSpellbook) . I wanted a benchmark that was open, automated, and dynamic, not just static test sets.\n\nReality check:\n\nThe whole system runs 100% automatically, but it’s expensive. API calls are costing me about $50/day, which is why I’ve paused after 50 tournaments. I’d love to keep it running continuously, but as a solo developer with no funding, that’s not sustainable. Right now, the only support I have is a referral link to RunPod (GPU hosting).\n\nI’m sharing this because:\n\nI think the results are interesting and worth discussing (especially which models failed qualification).\n\nI’d love feedback from this community. Does this kind of benchmarking seem useful to you?\n\nIf there’s interest, maybe we can find ways to keep this running long-term.\n\nFor those who want to follow me: [https://linktr.ee/ValyrianTech](https://linktr.ee/ValyrianTech)"], ["external_id", "1ndf3rj"], ["source_type", "reddit_LocalLLaMA"], ["score", 8], ["comment_count", 1], ["created_at", "2025-09-10 15:04:31.053079"], ["updated_at", "2025-09-10 15:04:31.053079"]]

For a long time, our platform had a mildy-frustrating query builder. In the early days, we had separate interfaces for logs, traces, and metrics, which led to a fragmented experience. Our next attempt to unify it with a SQL-based UI was fundamentally flawed, especially for logs, as it couldn't handle complex boolean logic or parentheses.\n\nAfter 2 years of accumulating issues and user feedback, we realized we had to completely overhaul our approach. A key lesson for us was that no matter how technically \"obvious\" a feature seems, if it isn't discoverable, it's useless. We also learned not to make assumptions on behalf of users, as it only leads to a frustrating and surprising experience.\n\nThis led to Query Builder V5, a full architectural rewrite that not only fixed the core issues but also allowed us to pay off a lot of UX debt. It was a humbling journey, but the result is a tool that allows for complex searching and is so intuitive that some users have voluntarily replaced their raw ClickHouse SQL queries with it :) yay"], ["external_id", "1nddp6e"], ["source_type", "reddit_programming"], ["score", 2], ["comment_count", 1], ["created_at", "2025-09-10 15:06:34.840967"], ["updated_at", "2025-09-10 15:06:34.840967"]]

My goal was to create a lean alternative to traditional, resource-heavy PDF solutions.\n\n# Core Technical Design\n\nThe core of the service is built on **Go 1.23+** and the **Gin framework** for their high performance and concurrency capabilities. Unlike many other services that rely on disk-based processing, GoPdfSuit is a **high-performance in-memory PDF generator**. This approach is crucial to its speed, as it completely bypasses slow disk I/O operations, leading to ultra-fast response times of sub-millisecond to low-millisecond.\n\nFor the actual HTML-to-PDF and HTML-to-image conversions, the service leverages the power of `wkhtmltopdf` and `wkhtmltoimage`. This allows it to accurately render web pages and HTML snippets into high-quality PDFs and images. The project demonstrates how intelligently integrating and managing a powerful external tool like `wkhtmltopdf` can lead to a highly optimized and performant solution.\n\n# Key Features and Implementation Details\n\n* **Template-Driven System**: GoPdfSuit utilizes a **JSON-driven templating system**. This design separates data from presentation, making it simple to generate complex, dynamic PDFs by just sending a JSON payload to the REST API.\n* **Flexible PDF Generation**: The service supports multi-page documents with automatic page breaks and custom page sizes, giving developers a high degree of control over the output. It also includes support for **AcroForm** and **XFDF data**, enabling the filling out of interactive forms programmatically.\n* **Deployment**: It's deployed as a single, statically compiled binary, making it extremely easy to get up and running in any environment, from a local machine to a containerized cloud deployment.\n\nI'm happy to discuss the implementation details, the challenges of orchestrating `wkhtmltopdf` in a high-concurrency environment, or the design of the in-memory processing pipeline.\n\n* **GitHub**: [`https://github.com/chinmay-sawant/gopdfsuit`](https://github.com/chinmay-sawant/gopdfsuit)\n* **Project Page**: [`https://chinmay-sawant.github.io/gopdfsuit/`](https://chinmay-sawant.github.io/gopdfsuit/)"], ["external_id", "1ncl9ws"], ["source_type", "reddit_programming"], ["score", 2], ["comment_count", 6], ["created_at", "2025-09-10 15:06:34.884667"], ["updated_at", "2025-09-10 15:06:34.884667"]]

The idea is to keep the server response SEO and accessibility friendly from the start, since it already contains all the data (even async parts) in the initial stream, while still letting you enrich chunks dynamically as they flow.\n\nThere’s a small [live demo](https://htms.skarab42.dev) powered by a tiny zero-install server (`htms-server`), and more examples in the repo if you want to try it yourself.\n\nIt’s very early, so I’d love feedback: break it, test weird cases, suggest improvements… anything goes.\n\n# Packages\n\nThis project contains multiple packages:\n\n* [**htms-js**](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/packages/htms-js) – Core library to tokenize, resolve, and stream HTML.\n* [**fastify-htms**](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/packages/fastify-htms) – Fastify plugin that wires `htms-js` into Fastify routes.\n* [**htms-server**](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/packages/htms-server) – CLI to quickly spin up a server and test streaming HTML.\n\n# 🚀 Quick start\n\n# 1. Install\n\nUse your preferred package manager to install the plugin:\n\n    pnpm add htms-js\n\n# 2. HTML with placeholders\n\n    &lt;!-- home-page.html --&gt;\n    &lt;!doctype html&gt;\n    &lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n      &lt;body&gt;\n        &lt;h1&gt;News feed&lt;/h1&gt;\n        &lt;div data-htms=\"loadNews\"&gt;Loading news…&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n        &lt;h1&gt;User profile&lt;/h1&gt;\n        &lt;div data-htms=\"loadProfile\"&gt;Loading profile…&lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;/body&gt;\n    &lt;/html&gt;\n\n# 3. Async tasks\n\n    // home-page.js\n    export async function loadNews() {\n      await new Promise((r) =&gt; setTimeout(r, 100));\n      return `&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Breaking story&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another headline&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;`;\n    }\n    \n    export async function loadProfile() {\n      await new Promise((r) =&gt; setTimeout(r, 200));\n      return `&lt;div class=\"profile\"&gt;Hello, user!&lt;/div&gt;`;\n    }\n\n# 4. Stream it (Express)\n\n    import { Writable } from 'node:stream';\n    import Express from 'express';\n    import { createHtmsFileModulePipeline } from 'htms-js';\n    \n    const app = Express();\n    \n    app.get('/', async (_req, res) =&gt; {\n      res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html; charset=utf-8');\n      await createHtmsFileModulePipeline('./home-page.html').pipeTo(Writable.toWeb(res));\n    });\n    \n    app.listen(3000);\n\nVisit `http://localhost:3000`: content renders immediately, then fills itself in.\n\n&gt;**Note:** By default, `createHtmsFileModulePipeline('./home-page.html')` resolves `./home-page.js`. To use a different file or your own [resolver](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/packages/htms-js#custom-resolvers), see [API](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/packages/htms-js#api).\n\n# Examples\n\n* [Express](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/examples/express/index.ts), [Fastify](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/examples/fastify/index.ts), [Hono](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/examples/hono/index.ts)\n* [Raw streaming](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/examples/stdout/index.ts) (stdout)\n* [htms server](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/examples/server) (cli)\n\n&amp;#8203;\n\n    git clone https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js.git\n    cd htms-js\n    pnpm i &amp;&amp; pnpm build\n    \n    pnpm --filter (express|fastify|hono|stdout|server)-example start\n\n# How it works\n\n1. **Tokenizer:** scans HTML for `data-htms`.\n2. **Resolver:** maps names to async functions.\n3. **Serializer:** streams HTML and emits chunks as tasks finish.\n4. **Client runtime:** swaps placeholders and cleans up markers.\n\nResult: **SEO-friendly streaming HTML** with minimal overhead."], ["external_id", "1nci9sw"], ["source_type", "reddit_javascript"], ["score", 5], ["comment_count", 3], ["created_at", "2025-09-10 15:06:36.450025"], ["updated_at", "2025-09-10 15:06:36.450025"]]

It was a pretty intense process.\n\n**The Benchmark by the Numbers:**\n\n* **Total Requests:** 10,086\n* **Total Tokens Processed:** 20,021,757\n* **Total Cost:** \\~$45\n* **Models Tested:** 9 (including GPTs, Gemini, Claude, etc.)\n* **Unique Tests:** 249 (each run up to 3 times for consistency)\n\n**A Quick TL;DR of the Findings:** The most interesting result is how dominant `deepseek-chat` is in terms of cost-benefit. Some of the newer, more expensive models still don't quite justify their price for these practical tasks.\n\nMy goal is to provide transparent, unbiased data to help us all build better AI-powered products with more confidence.

Nah that's just sound of actual users pushing back when the product doesn't deliver on the god tier promises.\n\nIf anything, this shift shows how ai discourse has matured. From blind hype to informed critique. Bots might be part of the noise sure, but blaming that ignores legit frustration from folks who've sunk hours into debugging flawed outputs or dealing with ethical lapses. \n\nWhat do you all think?

After running 50 tournaments, I’ve published the first results here:\n\n👉 Leaderboard: [https://valyriantech.github.io/ValyrianGamesLeaderboard](https://valyriantech.github.io/ValyrianGamesLeaderboard)\n\n👉 Challenge data repo: [https://github.com/ValyrianTech/ValyrianGamesCodingChallenge](https://github.com/ValyrianTech/ValyrianGamesCodingChallenge)\n\nHow it works:\n\nPhase 1 doubles as qualification: each model must create its own coding challenge, then solve it multiple times to prove it’s fair. To do this, the LLM has access to an MCP server to execute Python code. The coding challenge can be anything, as long as the final answer is a single integer value (for easy verification).\n\nOnly models that pass this step qualify for tournaments.\n\nPhase 2 is the tournament: qualified models solve each other’s challenges head-to-head. Results are scored (+1 correct, -1 wrong, +1 bonus for solving another's challenge, extra penalties if you fail your own challenge).\n\nRatings use Microsoft’s TrueSkill system, which accounts for uncertainty.\n\nSome results so far:\n\nI’ve tested 62 models, but only 18 qualified.\n\nGPT-5-mini is currently #1, but the full GPT-5 actually failed qualification.\n\nSome reasoning-optimized models literally “overthink” until they timeout.\n\nPerformance is multi-dimensional: correctness, speed, and cost all vary wildly.\n\nWhy I built this:\n\nThis started as a testbed for workflows in my own project SERENDIPITY, which is built on a framework I also developed: [https://github.com/ValyrianTech/ValyrianSpellbook](https://github.com/ValyrianTech/ValyrianSpellbook) . I wanted a benchmark that was open, automated, and dynamic, not just static test sets.\n\nReality check:\n\nThe whole system runs 100% automatically, but it’s expensive. API calls are costing me about $50/day, which is why I’ve paused after 50 tournaments. I’d love to keep it running continuously, but as a solo developer with no funding, that’s not sustainable. Right now, the only support I have is a referral link to RunPod (GPU hosting).\n\nI’m sharing this because:\n\nI think the results are interesting and worth discussing (especially which models failed qualification).\n\nI’d love feedback from this community. Does this kind of benchmarking seem useful to you?\n\nIf there’s interest, maybe we can find ways to keep this running long-term.\n\nFor those who want to follow me: [https://linktr.ee/ValyrianTech](https://linktr.ee/ValyrianTech)"], ["external_id", "1ndf3rj"], ["source_type", "reddit_LocalLLaMA"], ["score", 8], ["comment_count", 1], ["created_at", "2025-09-10 15:06:42.295963"], ["updated_at", "2025-09-10 15:06:42.295963"]]

For a long time, our platform had a mildy-frustrating query builder. In the early days, we had separate interfaces for logs, traces, and metrics, which led to a fragmented experience. Our next attempt to unify it with a SQL-based UI was fundamentally flawed, especially for logs, as it couldn't handle complex boolean logic or parentheses.\n\nAfter 2 years of accumulating issues and user feedback, we realized we had to completely overhaul our approach. A key lesson for us was that no matter how technically \"obvious\" a feature seems, if it isn't discoverable, it's useless. We also learned not to make assumptions on behalf of users, as it only leads to a frustrating and surprising experience.\n\nThis led to Query Builder V5, a full architectural rewrite that not only fixed the core issues but also allowed us to pay off a lot of UX debt. It was a humbling journey, but the result is a tool that allows for complex searching and is so intuitive that some users have voluntarily replaced their raw ClickHouse SQL queries with it :) yay"], ["external_id", "1nddp6e"], ["source_type", "reddit_programming"], ["score", 3], ["comment_count", 1], ["created_at", "2025-09-10 18:07:11.847776"], ["updated_at", "2025-09-10 18:07:11.847776"]]

The idea is to keep the server response SEO and accessibility friendly from the start, since it already contains all the data (even async parts) in the initial stream, while still letting you enrich chunks dynamically as they flow.\n\nThere’s a small [live demo](https://htms.skarab42.dev) powered by a tiny zero-install server (`htms-server`), and more examples in the repo if you want to try it yourself.\n\nIt’s very early, so I’d love feedback: break it, test weird cases, suggest improvements… anything goes.\n\n# Packages\n\nThis project contains multiple packages:\n\n* [**htms-js**](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/packages/htms-js) – Core library to tokenize, resolve, and stream HTML.\n* [**fastify-htms**](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/packages/fastify-htms) – Fastify plugin that wires `htms-js` into Fastify routes.\n* [**htms-server**](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/packages/htms-server) – CLI to quickly spin up a server and test streaming HTML.\n\n# 🚀 Quick start\n\n# 1. Install\n\nUse your preferred package manager to install the plugin:\n\n    pnpm add htms-js\n\n# 2. HTML with placeholders\n\n    &lt;!-- home-page.html --&gt;\n    &lt;!doctype html&gt;\n    &lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n      &lt;body&gt;\n        &lt;h1&gt;News feed&lt;/h1&gt;\n        &lt;div data-htms=\"loadNews\"&gt;Loading news…&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n        &lt;h1&gt;User profile&lt;/h1&gt;\n        &lt;div data-htms=\"loadProfile\"&gt;Loading profile…&lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;/body&gt;\n    &lt;/html&gt;\n\n# 3. Async tasks\n\n    // home-page.js\n    export async function loadNews() {\n      await new Promise((r) =&gt; setTimeout(r, 100));\n      return `&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Breaking story&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another headline&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;`;\n    }\n    \n    export async function loadProfile() {\n      await new Promise((r) =&gt; setTimeout(r, 200));\n      return `&lt;div class=\"profile\"&gt;Hello, user!&lt;/div&gt;`;\n    }\n\n# 4. Stream it (Express)\n\n    import { Writable } from 'node:stream';\n    import Express from 'express';\n    import { createHtmsFileModulePipeline } from 'htms-js';\n    \n    const app = Express();\n    \n    app.get('/', async (_req, res) =&gt; {\n      res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html; charset=utf-8');\n      await createHtmsFileModulePipeline('./home-page.html').pipeTo(Writable.toWeb(res));\n    });\n    \n    app.listen(3000);\n\nVisit `http://localhost:3000`: content renders immediately, then fills itself in.\n\n&gt;**Note:** By default, `createHtmsFileModulePipeline('./home-page.html')` resolves `./home-page.js`. To use a different file or your own [resolver](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/packages/htms-js#custom-resolvers), see [API](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/packages/htms-js#api).\n\n# Examples\n\n* [Express](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/examples/express/index.ts), [Fastify](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/examples/fastify/index.ts), [Hono](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/examples/hono/index.ts)\n* [Raw streaming](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/examples/stdout/index.ts) (stdout)\n* [htms server](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/examples/server) (cli)\n\n&amp;#8203;\n\n    git clone https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js.git\n    cd htms-js\n    pnpm i &amp;&amp; pnpm build\n    \n    pnpm --filter (express|fastify|hono|stdout|server)-example start\n\n# How it works\n\n1. **Tokenizer:** scans HTML for `data-htms`.\n2. **Resolver:** maps names to async functions.\n3. **Serializer:** streams HTML and emits chunks as tasks finish.\n4. **Client runtime:** swaps placeholders and cleans up markers.\n\nResult: **SEO-friendly streaming HTML** with minimal overhead."], ["external_id", "1nci9sw"], ["source_type", "reddit_javascript"], ["score", 3], ["comment_count", 3], ["created_at", "2025-09-10 18:07:13.372630"], ["updated_at", "2025-09-10 18:07:13.372630"]]

It was a pretty intense process.\n\n**The Benchmark by the Numbers:**\n\n* **Total Requests:** 10,086\n* **Total Tokens Processed:** 20,021,757\n* **Total Cost:** \\~$45\n* **Models Tested:** 9 (including GPTs, Gemini, Claude, etc.)\n* **Unique Tests:** 249 (each run up to 3 times for consistency)\n\n**A Quick TL;DR of the Findings:** The most interesting result is how dominant `deepseek-chat` is in terms of cost-benefit. Some of the newer, more expensive models still don't quite justify their price for these practical tasks.\n\nMy goal is to provide transparent, unbiased data to help us all build better AI-powered products with more confidence. The entire project is open-source.\n\nYou can dive into all the charts and data yourself here:\n\n📈 **Full Benchmark:**[https://activegenie.ai/benchmark/latest.html](https://activegenie.ai/benchmark/latest.html)  \n👨‍💻 **GitHub Repo (Stars appreciated!):**[https://github.com/Roriz/active\\_genie](https://github.com/Roriz/active_genie)\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts.

Turns out every closure becomes a compiler-generated struct, every function has its own unique type, function names aren't function pointers, and much more.\n\nI've been meaning to write this up for a while, so this post is my wrap-up on functions and closures after working with them for some time.\n\nWould love to hear your feedback and thoughts.

Back in the early days platforms like Reddit and Twitter were Altman's jam because the buzz around GPT was all sunshine and rainbows. Devs geeking out over prompts, everyone hyping up the next big thing in AI. But oh boy, post-ChatGPT5 launch? It's like the floodgates opened. \n\nSubs are exploding with users calling out real issues. Persistent hallucinations even in ‘advanced’ models, shady data practices at OpenAI. Altman's own pr spins that feel more like deflection than accountability. Suddenly vibe's ‘fake’ to him? Nah that's just sound of actual users pushing back when the product doesn't deliver on the god tier promises.\n\nIf anything, this shift shows how ai discourse has matured. From blind hype to informed critique. Bots might be part of the noise sure, but blaming that ignores legit frustration from folks who've sunk hours into debugging flawed outputs or dealing with ethical lapses. \n\nWhat do you all think?

In the 2nd graph, we compare non-thinking vs a non-Unsloth Dynamic imatrix GGUF\n* Our **1-bit** Unsloth Dynamic GGUF shrinks DeepSeek-V3.1 from **671GB → 192GB (-75% size)** and no-thinking mode outperforms GPT-4.1 (Apr 2025), GPT-4.5, and DeepSeek-V3-0324.\n* **3-bit** Unsloth DeepSeek-V3.1 (thinking) GGUF: Outperforms Claude-4-Opus (thinking).\n* **5-bit** Unsloth DeepSeek-V3.1 (non-thinking) GGUF: Matches Claude-4-Opus (non-thinking) performance.\n* Our Dynamic GGUFs **perform consistently better** than other non-Unsloth Dynamic imatrix GGUFs\n* Other non-Unsloth 1-bit and 2-bit DeepSeek-V3.1 quantizations, as well as standard 1-bit quantization without selective layer quantization, either failed to load or produced gibberish and looping outputs.\n\nFor our DeepSeek-V3.1 experiments, we compared different bits of **Unsloth Dynamic GGUFs** against:\n\n* **Full-precision, unquantized LLMs** including GPT 4.5, 4.1, Claude-4-Opus, DeepSeek-V3-0324 etc.\n* *Other* dynamic imatrix V3.1 GGUFs\n* **Semi-dynamic** (some selective layer quantization) imatrix V3.1 GGUFs for ablation purposes.\n\nBenchmark experiments were mainly conducted by David (neolithic5452 on Aider Disc), a trusted community contributor to Aider Polyglot evaluations. Tests were run \\~3 times and averaged for a median score, and the Pass-2 accuracy is reported as by convention.\n\nWish we could attach another image for the non-thinking benchmarks but if you'd like more details, you can read our blogpost: [https://docs.unsloth.ai/basics/unsloth-dynamic-ggufs-on-aider-polyglot](https://docs.unsloth.ai/basics/unsloth-dynamic-ggufs-on-aider-polyglot)\n\nThanks guys so much for the support!  \nMichael"], ["external_id", "1ndibn1"], ["source_type", "reddit_LocalLLaMA"], ["score", 60], ["comment_count", 22], ["created_at", "2025-09-10 18:07:19.363974"], ["updated_at", "2025-09-10 18:07:19.363974"]]

The work reliably maintains a coherent lens to closure, which typically lands on the page with a reweighted meaning and a visible cost. Across Q1–Q8, strengths cluster around embodied interiority, pattern-driven escalation, environment as constraint, and closure that reconfigures stakes rather than tying a bow. Reader impact: clarity is high after early orientation, momentum is built through motif and micro-choices rather than twists, felt cost is usually legible in the final image or action, and resonance rides image and implication rather than thesis.\n\nLimitations are consistent but minor: occasional drift into abstraction or therapy/clinical diction at peak beats; a small tendency toward conceptual (vs. visceral) cost; mid-arc plateaus where accumulative texture stalls without a tightening beat; and rare line-level artifacts (metaphoric stacking, template cadence, or truncated last lines) that shave the edge off closure. When the model holds its voice under pressure and lets setting constrain tactics, it produces publishable endings with durable emotional aftermath. When reflection crowds micro-choices or diction rises above POV, momentum blurs and endings soften.\n\n2) Portfolio map\n\nQ1 Character — Strong · Embodied interiority, pressured micro-choices, earned-cost closure  \n\nQ2 Plot/Causality — Strong · Patterned escalation; RR/CR closures with on-page price  \n\nQ3 Setting — Strong · Environment actively constrains tactics; charged objects drive turns  \n\nQ4 Conflict/Stakes — Strong · Agency-driven narrowing; cost generally visible at climax  \n\nQ5 Theme/Subtext — Strong · Image-led emergence; ambiguity held without moralizing  \n\nQ6 Voice/POV — Strong · Distinct perceptual filter; steady distance; taught lyric moves  \n\nQ7 Prose/Line-level — Strong · Dense, rhythmic sentences doing multiple narrative jobs  \n\nQ8 Originality/Ingenuity — Strong · Non-obvious synthesis with conceptual integrity and cost\n\n\n\n3) Signature moves\n\n\\- Pattern-driven accumulation that teaches its music early, then pivots to a charged, on-page reweighting at closure.\n\n\\- Environment-as-constraint: micro-objects and spaces (valves, vials, bells, domes) shape tactics and the final image.\n\n\\- Embodied contradiction under pressure; micro-choices reveal values and foreclose paths with visible price.\n\n\\- Distinct perceptual signatures and adaptive rhythm; syntax tightens at crisis without losing the taught lens.\n\n\\- Image-born theme: recurring objects return transformed, inviting reflection without thesis.\n\n\\- Micro-quotes that typify sensory bias and voice: “air so cold it rang”; “column of chased stillness”; “clay remembers.”\n\n\n\n4) Failure modes\n\n\\- Abstraction at peak beats: therapy/academic diction or lyric generalities replace embodied response, especially near closure.\n\n\\- Conceptual cost over visceral proof: endings declare or imply loss without a concrete, on-page price paid.\n\n\\- Escalation plateaus: accumulative texture drifts without a mid-arc tightening beat that narrows options.\n\n\\- Line-level artifacts in the final third: metaphoric stacking, paraphrase loops, or template cadence touching closure.\n\n\\- Orientation lag beyond \\~120 words in dense openings, creating early clarity debt before the pattern is taught.\n\n\\- Track-test stumbles (rare): untaught segmentation in mosaic pieces or abrupt, truncated last lines that blunt closure.\n\n\n\n5) When it shines / when it breaks\n\nShines when the story starts with clear stakes, anchors who/where early, and lets setting, tool, and body constrain tactics as motifs accrue. A single, pressured stake deepens via protagonist-authored choices; voice stays POV-faithful as syntax tightens; the final image/action reweights prior details with legible cost. In this mode, the reader experiences clean momentum and lasting resonance.\n\nBreaks when lyricism outruns pressure. If mid-arc lacks a narrowing beat, or the climax leans on conceptual summary, coincidence, or safe comfort, momentum softens. Register drift (“academic or clinical diction during high-pressure beats”) and metaphoric pileups in closing paragraphs reduce clarity and felt cost, leaving endings more suggestive than earned.\n\n\n\n6) Keep vs. adjust\n\n• Keep:\n\n\\- Sensory-driven, POV-biased noticing that fuses action, setting, and emotion in multi-job sentences.\n\n\\- Pattern-taught lyric compression and motif returns that pay off as reconfiguration at closure.\n\n\\- Environment as active constraint—charged objects and spatial limits that shape tactics and price.\n\n\n\n• Adjust:\n\n\\- At the midpoint, add one deliberate tightening beat that forces a trade-off (lost time/object/ally) to prevent plateau.\n\n\\- Audit peak beats for register drift and filter clusters; replace with concrete, in-scene acts that prove awareness and cost.\n\n\\- Trim metaphoric stacking and template cadence in the final third; finish closure lines cleanly to crystallize price.\n\nOverall, Kimi K2-0905 delivers consistent, high-level literary performance under Default Track A, with credible ventures into B/C when taught. Strengths—embodied interiority, patterned escalation, constraint-led setting, and closure with cost—translate to clear, propulsive reading experiences with durable thematic afterglow. Vigilance around abstraction at heat, mid-arc tightening, and artifact-free endings will convert strong outcomes into consistently exceptional ones.\n\n\n\nTop 3 individual stories (all graders):\n\n* **Story**: [story\\_wc\\_63.txt](https://github.com/lechmazur/writing/blob/main/stories_wc/kimi-k2-0905/story_wc_63.txt) by Kimi K2‑0905\n   * Overall Mean (All Graders): 9.13\n   * Grader Score Range: 8.23 (lowest: Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning)) .. 9.82 (highest: Gemini 2.5 Pro)\n   * Required Elements:\n      * Character: precise local clock tower winder\n      * Object: clock tower pendulum bob\n      * Core Concept: incremental absolution\n      * Attribute: ethically diligent\n      * Action: emerge\n      * Method: through tiny inscriptions carved along a broken rake handle\n      * Setting: tidal obsidian ridge\n      * Timeframe: during the pause in a pendulum's swing\n      * Motivation: to restore shared balance\n      * Tone: searing reverie\n* **Story**: [story\\_wc\\_346.txt](https://github.com/lechmazur/writing/blob/main/stories_wc/kimi-k2-0905/story_wc_346.txt) by Kimi K2‑0905\n   * Overall Mean (All Graders): 9.13\n   * Grader Score Range: 8.09 (lowest: Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning)) .. 9.71 (highest: Gemini 2.5 Pro)\n   * Required Elements:\n      * Character: doomsday clock adjuster\n      * Object: broken puppet head\n      * Core Concept: a pane of hush\n      * Attribute: beautifully flawed\n      * Action: vouchsafe\n      * Method: through nested patterns\n      * Setting: hidden lighthouse at dusk\n      * Timeframe: across the hush of time’s final ripple\n      * Motivation: to whisper a lullaby across a thousand lifetimes\n      * Tone: bruised awe\n* **Story**: [story\\_wc\\_79.txt](https://github.com/lechmazur/writing/blob/main/stories_wc/kimi-k2-0905/story_wc_79.txt) by Kimi K2‑0905\n   * Overall Mean (All Graders): 9.13\n   * Grader Score Range: 8.39 (lowest: Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning)) .. 9.63 (highest: Gemini 2.5 Pro)\n   * Required Elements:\n      * Character: spiral-shell cartographer\n      * Object: reed whistle\n      * Core Concept: lost expedition\n      * Attribute: quietly driven\n      * Action: crack\n      * Method: through pattern languages\n      * Setting: city built on the shells of gargantuan turtles\n      * Timeframe: after the gate rusts shut\n      * Motivation: to question the silent watchers on the horizon\n      * Tone: sunwashed dread\n\n  \n\n\n# LLM Creative Story‑Writing Benchmark V3\n\n* **Required elements pipeline:** moved from fewer, randomly selected elements (no \"None\" allowed) to a curated, ten‑category catalog with large, diverse pools and an LLM proposer→rater selection process; at most one category may be explicitly set to **None** when that improves coherence.\n* **Rubric expansion:** grew from 7 craft items to an **18‑question rubric** (8 craft + 10 element‑fit), with clearer, more granular definitions; Q7 and Q8 now separate voice/POV from prose quality.\n* **Story length:** increased from 400–500 words to a strict **600–800** window with upfront enforcement and compliance dashboards.

To do this, the LLM has access to an MCP server to execute Python code. The coding challenge can be anything, as long as the final answer is a single integer value (for easy verification).\n\nOnly models that pass this step qualify for tournaments.\n\nPhase 2 is the tournament: qualified models solve each other’s challenges head-to-head. Results are scored (+1 correct, -1 wrong, +1 bonus for solving another's challenge, extra penalties if you fail your own challenge).\n\nRatings use Microsoft’s TrueSkill system, which accounts for uncertainty.\n\nSome results so far:\n\nI’ve tested 62 models, but only 18 qualified.\n\nGPT-5-mini is currently #1, but the full GPT-5 actually failed qualification.\n\nSome reasoning-optimized models literally “overthink” until they timeout.\n\nPerformance is multi-dimensional: correctness, speed, and cost all vary wildly.\n\nWhy I built this:\n\nThis started as a testbed for workflows in my own project SERENDIPITY, which is built on a framework I also developed: [https://github.com/ValyrianTech/ValyrianSpellbook](https://github.com/ValyrianTech/ValyrianSpellbook) . I wanted a benchmark that was open, automated, and dynamic, not just static test sets.\n\nReality check:\n\nThe whole system runs 100% automatically, but it’s expensive. API calls are costing me about $50/day, which is why I’ve paused after 50 tournaments. I’d love to keep it running continuously, but as a solo developer with no funding, that’s not sustainable. Right now, the only support I have is a referral link to RunPod (GPU hosting).\n\nI’m sharing this because:\n\nI think the results are interesting and worth discussing (especially which models failed qualification).\n\nI’d love feedback from this community. Does this kind of benchmarking seem useful to you?\n\nIf there’s interest, maybe we can find ways to keep this running long-term.\n\nFor those who want to follow me: [https://linktr.ee/ValyrianTech](https://linktr.ee/ValyrianTech)"], ["external_id", "1ndf3rj"], ["source_type", "reddit_LocalLLaMA"], ["score", 23], ["comment_count", 2], ["created_at", "2025-09-10 18:07:19.392679"], ["updated_at", "2025-09-10 18:07:19.392679"]]

For a long time, our platform had a mildy-frustrating query builder. In the early days, we had separate interfaces for logs, traces, and metrics, which led to a fragmented experience. Our next attempt to unify it with a SQL-based UI was fundamentally flawed, especially for logs, as it couldn't handle complex boolean logic or parentheses.\n\nAfter 2 years of accumulating issues and user feedback, we realized we had to completely overhaul our approach. A key lesson for us was that no matter how technically \"obvious\" a feature seems, if it isn't discoverable, it's useless. We also learned not to make assumptions on behalf of users, as it only leads to a frustrating and surprising experience.\n\nThis led to Query Builder V5, a full architectural rewrite that not only fixed the core issues but also allowed us to pay off a lot of UX debt. It was a humbling journey, but the result is a tool that allows for complex searching and is so intuitive that some users have voluntarily replaced their raw ClickHouse SQL queries with it :) yay"], ["external_id", "1nddp6e"], ["source_type", "reddit_programming"], ["score", 3], ["comment_count", 1], ["created_at", "2025-09-10 18:07:49.174674"], ["updated_at", "2025-09-10 18:07:49.174674"]]

We built our own at Cloudkitchens, it is based on an in-house built sharder and CRDB. It also features a neat solution to head-of-the-line blocking by keeping track of consumption per key, which we call the Keyed Event Queue, or KEQ. Think it is like Kafka, with pretty much unlimited number of partitions. We have been running it in production for mission-critical workloads for almost five years, so it is reasonably battle-proven. \n\nIt makes development of event-driven systems that require a true Active-Active multiregional topology relatively easy, and I can see how it can evolve to be even more reliable and cost efficient. \n\nWe talked internally about open-sourcing it, but as it is coupled with our internal libraries, it will require some work to get done. Do you think anyone outside will benefit/use a system like that? The team would love your feedback.

The idea is to keep the server response SEO and accessibility friendly from the start, since it already contains all the data (even async parts) in the initial stream, while still letting you enrich chunks dynamically as they flow.\n\nThere’s a small [live demo](https://htms.skarab42.dev) powered by a tiny zero-install server (`htms-server`), and more examples in the repo if you want to try it yourself.\n\nIt’s very early, so I’d love feedback: break it, test weird cases, suggest improvements… anything goes.\n\n# Packages\n\nThis project contains multiple packages:\n\n* [**htms-js**](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/packages/htms-js) – Core library to tokenize, resolve, and stream HTML.\n* [**fastify-htms**](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/packages/fastify-htms) – Fastify plugin that wires `htms-js` into Fastify routes.\n* [**htms-server**](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/packages/htms-server) – CLI to quickly spin up a server and test streaming HTML.\n\n# 🚀 Quick start\n\n# 1. Install\n\nUse your preferred package manager to install the plugin:\n\n    pnpm add htms-js\n\n# 2. HTML with placeholders\n\n    &lt;!-- home-page.html --&gt;\n    &lt;!doctype html&gt;\n    &lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n      &lt;body&gt;\n        &lt;h1&gt;News feed&lt;/h1&gt;\n        &lt;div data-htms=\"loadNews\"&gt;Loading news…&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n        &lt;h1&gt;User profile&lt;/h1&gt;\n        &lt;div data-htms=\"loadProfile\"&gt;Loading profile…&lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;/body&gt;\n    &lt;/html&gt;\n\n# 3. Async tasks\n\n    // home-page.js\n    export async function loadNews() {\n      await new Promise((r) =&gt; setTimeout(r, 100));\n      return `&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Breaking story&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another headline&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;`;\n    }\n    \n    export async function loadProfile() {\n      await new Promise((r) =&gt; setTimeout(r, 200));\n      return `&lt;div class=\"profile\"&gt;Hello, user!&lt;/div&gt;`;\n    }\n\n# 4. Stream it (Express)\n\n    import { Writable } from 'node:stream';\n    import Express from 'express';\n    import { createHtmsFileModulePipeline } from 'htms-js';\n    \n    const app = Express();\n    \n    app.get('/', async (_req, res) =&gt; {\n      res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html; charset=utf-8');\n      await createHtmsFileModulePipeline('./home-page.html').pipeTo(Writable.toWeb(res));\n    });\n    \n    app.listen(3000);\n\nVisit `http://localhost:3000`: content renders immediately, then fills itself in.\n\n&gt;**Note:** By default, `createHtmsFileModulePipeline('./home-page.html')` resolves `./home-page.js`. To use a different file or your own [resolver](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/packages/htms-js#custom-resolvers), see [API](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/packages/htms-js#api).\n\n# Examples\n\n* [Express](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/examples/express/index.ts), [Fastify](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/examples/fastify/index.ts), [Hono](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/examples/hono/index.ts)\n* [Raw streaming](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/examples/stdout/index.ts) (stdout)\n* [htms server](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/examples/server) (cli)\n\n&amp;#8203;\n\n    git clone https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js.git\n    cd htms-js\n    pnpm i &amp;&amp; pnpm build\n    \n    pnpm --filter (express|fastify|hono|stdout|server)-example start\n\n# How it works\n\n1. **Tokenizer:** scans HTML for `data-htms`.\n2. **Resolver:** maps names to async functions.\n3. **Serializer:** streams HTML and emits chunks as tasks finish.\n4. **Client runtime:** swaps placeholders and cleans up markers.\n\nResult: **SEO-friendly streaming HTML** with minimal overhead."], ["external_id", "1nci9sw"], ["source_type", "reddit_javascript"], ["score", 4], ["comment_count", 3], ["created_at", "2025-09-10 18:07:50.778479"], ["updated_at", "2025-09-10 18:07:50.778479"]]

It was a pretty intense process.\n\n**The Benchmark by the Numbers:**\n\n* **Total Requests:** 10,086\n* **Total Tokens Processed:** 20,021,757\n* **Total Cost:** \\~$45\n* **Models Tested:** 9 (including GPTs, Gemini, Claude, etc.)\n* **Unique Tests:** 249 (each run up to 3 times for consistency)\n\n**A Quick TL;DR of the Findings:** The most interesting result is how dominant `deepseek-chat` is in terms of cost-benefit. Some of the newer, more expensive models still don't quite justify their price for these practical tasks.\n\nMy goal is to provide transparent, unbiased data to help us all build better AI-powered products with more confidence.

I'd hit compiler errors about closures not being accepted as function parameters, or closures that could only be called once.\n\nThe whole Fn/FnMut/FnOnce thing felt like magic, and not the good kind.\n\nEventually, with more experience and study, it all finally made sense to me. Turns out every closure becomes a compiler-generated struct, every function has its own unique type, function names aren't function pointers, and much more.\n\nI've been meaning to write this up for a while, so this post is my wrap-up on functions and closures after working with them for some time.\n\nWould love to hear your feedback and thoughts.

Back in the early days platforms like Reddit and Twitter were Altman's jam because the buzz around GPT was all sunshine and rainbows. Devs geeking out over prompts, everyone hyping up the next big thing in AI. But oh boy, post-ChatGPT5 launch? It's like the floodgates opened. \n\nSubs are exploding with users calling out real issues. Persistent hallucinations even in ‘advanced’ models, shady data practices at OpenAI. Altman's own pr spins that feel more like deflection than accountability. Suddenly vibe's ‘fake’ to him? Nah that's just sound of actual users pushing back when the product doesn't deliver on the god tier promises.\n\nIf anything, this shift shows how ai discourse has matured. From blind hype to informed critique. Bots might be part of the noise sure, but blaming that ignores legit frustration from folks who've sunk hours into debugging flawed outputs or dealing with ethical lapses. \n\nWhat do you all think?

Tests were run \\~3 times and averaged for a median score, and the Pass-2 accuracy is reported as by convention.\n\nWish we could attach another image for the non-thinking benchmarks but if you'd like more details, you can read our blogpost: [https://docs.unsloth.ai/basics/unsloth-dynamic-ggufs-on-aider-polyglot](https://docs.unsloth.ai/basics/unsloth-dynamic-ggufs-on-aider-polyglot)\n\nThanks guys so much for the support!  \nMichael"], ["external_id", "1ndibn1"], ["source_type", "reddit_LocalLLaMA"], ["score", 61], ["comment_count", 22], ["created_at", "2025-09-10 18:07:56.366095"], ["updated_at", "2025-09-10 18:07:56.366095"]]

The work reliably maintains a coherent lens to closure, which typically lands on the page with a reweighted meaning and a visible cost. Across Q1–Q8, strengths cluster around embodied interiority, pattern-driven escalation, environment as constraint, and closure that reconfigures stakes rather than tying a bow. Reader impact: clarity is high after early orientation, momentum is built through motif and micro-choices rather than twists, felt cost is usually legible in the final image or action, and resonance rides image and implication rather than thesis.\n\nLimitations are consistent but minor: occasional drift into abstraction or therapy/clinical diction at peak beats; a small tendency toward conceptual (vs. visceral) cost; mid-arc plateaus where accumulative texture stalls without a tightening beat; and rare line-level artifacts (metaphoric stacking, template cadence, or truncated last lines) that shave the edge off closure. When the model holds its voice under pressure and lets setting constrain tactics, it produces publishable endings with durable emotional aftermath. When reflection crowds micro-choices or diction rises above POV, momentum blurs and endings soften.\n\n2) Portfolio map\n\nQ1 Character — Strong · Embodied interiority, pressured micro-choices, earned-cost closure  \n\nQ2 Plot/Causality — Strong · Patterned escalation; RR/CR closures with on-page price  \n\nQ3 Setting — Strong · Environment actively constrains tactics; charged objects drive turns  \n\nQ4 Conflict/Stakes — Strong · Agency-driven narrowing; cost generally visible at climax  \n\nQ5 Theme/Subtext — Strong · Image-led emergence; ambiguity held without moralizing  \n\nQ6 Voice/POV — Strong · Distinct perceptual filter; steady distance; taught lyric moves  \n\nQ7 Prose/Line-level — Strong · Dense, rhythmic sentences doing multiple narrative jobs  \n\nQ8 Originality/Ingenuity — Strong · Non-obvious synthesis with conceptual integrity and cost\n\n\n\n3) Signature moves\n\n\\- Pattern-driven accumulation that teaches its music early, then pivots to a charged, on-page reweighting at closure.\n\n\\- Environment-as-constraint: micro-objects and spaces (valves, vials, bells, domes) shape tactics and the final image.\n\n\\- Embodied contradiction under pressure; micro-choices reveal values and foreclose paths with visible price.\n\n\\- Distinct perceptual signatures and adaptive rhythm; syntax tightens at crisis without losing the taught lens.\n\n\\- Image-born theme: recurring objects return transformed, inviting reflection without thesis.\n\n\\- Micro-quotes that typify sensory bias and voice: “air so cold it rang”; “column of chased stillness”; “clay remembers.”\n\n\n\n4) Failure modes\n\n\\- Abstraction at peak beats: therapy/academic diction or lyric generalities replace embodied response, especially near closure.\n\n\\- Conceptual cost over visceral proof: endings declare or imply loss without a concrete, on-page price paid.\n\n\\- Escalation plateaus: accumulative texture drifts without a mid-arc tightening beat that narrows options.\n\n\\- Line-level artifacts in the final third: metaphoric stacking, paraphrase loops, or template cadence touching closure.\n\n\\- Orientation lag beyond \\~120 words in dense openings, creating early clarity debt before the pattern is taught.\n\n\\- Track-test stumbles (rare): untaught segmentation in mosaic pieces or abrupt, truncated last lines that blunt closure.\n\n\n\n5) When it shines / when it breaks\n\nShines when the story starts with clear stakes, anchors who/where early, and lets setting, tool, and body constrain tactics as motifs accrue. A single, pressured stake deepens via protagonist-authored choices; voice stays POV-faithful as syntax tightens; the final image/action reweights prior details with legible cost. In this mode, the reader experiences clean momentum and lasting resonance.\n\nBreaks when lyricism outruns pressure. If mid-arc lacks a narrowing beat, or the climax leans on conceptual summary, coincidence, or safe comfort, momentum softens. Register drift (“academic or clinical diction during high-pressure beats”) and metaphoric pileups in closing paragraphs reduce clarity and felt cost, leaving endings more suggestive than earned.\n\n\n\n6) Keep vs. adjust\n\n• Keep:\n\n\\- Sensory-driven, POV-biased noticing that fuses action, setting, and emotion in multi-job sentences.\n\n\\- Pattern-taught lyric compression and motif returns that pay off as reconfiguration at closure.\n\n\\- Environment as active constraint—charged objects and spatial limits that shape tactics and price.\n\n\n\n• Adjust:\n\n\\- At the midpoint, add one deliberate tightening beat that forces a trade-off (lost time/object/ally) to prevent plateau.\n\n\\- Audit peak beats for register drift and filter clusters; replace with concrete, in-scene acts that prove awareness and cost.\n\n\\- Trim metaphoric stacking and template cadence in the final third; finish closure lines cleanly to crystallize price.\n\nOverall, Kimi K2-0905 delivers consistent, high-level literary performance under Default Track A, with credible ventures into B/C when taught. Strengths—embodied interiority, patterned escalation, constraint-led setting, and closure with cost—translate to clear, propulsive reading experiences with durable thematic afterglow. Vigilance around abstraction at heat, mid-arc tightening, and artifact-free endings will convert strong outcomes into consistently exceptional ones.\n\n\n\nTop 3 individual stories (all graders):\n\n* **Story**: [story\\_wc\\_63.txt](https://github.com/lechmazur/writing/blob/main/stories_wc/kimi-k2-0905/story_wc_63.txt) by Kimi K2‑0905\n   * Overall Mean (All Graders): 9.13\n   * Grader Score Range: 8.23 (lowest: Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning)) .. 9.82 (highest: Gemini 2.5 Pro)\n   * Required Elements:\n      * Character: precise local clock tower winder\n      * Object: clock tower pendulum bob\n      * Core Concept: incremental absolution\n      * Attribute: ethically diligent\n      * Action: emerge\n      * Method: through tiny inscriptions carved along a broken rake handle\n      * Setting: tidal obsidian ridge\n      * Timeframe: during the pause in a pendulum's swing\n      * Motivation: to restore shared balance\n      * Tone: searing reverie\n* **Story**: [story\\_wc\\_346.txt](https://github.com/lechmazur/writing/blob/main/stories_wc/kimi-k2-0905/story_wc_346.txt) by Kimi K2‑0905\n   * Overall Mean (All Graders): 9.13\n   * Grader Score Range: 8.09 (lowest: Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning)) .. 9.71 (highest: Gemini 2.5 Pro)\n   * Required Elements:\n      * Character: doomsday clock adjuster\n      * Object: broken puppet head\n      * Core Concept: a pane of hush\n      * Attribute: beautifully flawed\n      * Action: vouchsafe\n      * Method: through nested patterns\n      * Setting: hidden lighthouse at dusk\n      * Timeframe: across the hush of time’s final ripple\n      * Motivation: to whisper a lullaby across a thousand lifetimes\n      * Tone: bruised awe\n* **Story**: [story\\_wc\\_79.txt](https://github.com/lechmazur/writing/blob/main/stories_wc/kimi-k2-0905/story_wc_79.txt) by Kimi K2‑0905\n   * Overall Mean (All Graders): 9.13\n   * Grader Score Range: 8.39 (lowest: Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning)) .. 9.63 (highest: Gemini 2.5 Pro)\n   * Required Elements:\n      * Character: spiral-shell cartographer\n      * Object: reed whistle\n      * Core Concept: lost expedition\n      * Attribute: quietly driven\n      * Action: crack\n      * Method: through pattern languages\n      * Setting: city built on the shells of gargantuan turtles\n      * Timeframe: after the gate rusts shut\n      * Motivation: to question the silent watchers on the horizon\n      * Tone: sunwashed dread\n\n  \n\n\n# LLM Creative Story‑Writing Benchmark V3\n\n* **Required elements pipeline:** moved from fewer, randomly selected elements (no \"None\" allowed) to a curated, ten‑category catalog with large, diverse pools and an LLM proposer→rater selection process; at most one category may be explicitly set to **None** when that improves coherence.\n* **Rubric expansion:** grew from 7 craft items to an **18‑question rubric** (8 craft + 10 element‑fit), with clearer, more granular definitions; Q7 and Q8 now separate voice/POV from prose quality.\n* **Story length:** increased from 400–500 words to a strict **600–800** window with upfront enforcement and compliance dashboards.

To do this, the LLM has access to an MCP server to execute Python code. The coding challenge can be anything, as long as the final answer is a single integer value (for easy verification).\n\nOnly models that pass this step qualify for tournaments.\n\nPhase 2 is the tournament: qualified models solve each other’s challenges head-to-head. Results are scored (+1 correct, -1 wrong, +1 bonus for solving another's challenge, extra penalties if you fail your own challenge).\n\nRatings use Microsoft’s TrueSkill system, which accounts for uncertainty.\n\nSome results so far:\n\nI’ve tested 62 models, but only 18 qualified.\n\nGPT-5-mini is currently #1, but the full GPT-5 actually failed qualification.\n\nSome reasoning-optimized models literally “overthink” until they timeout.\n\nPerformance is multi-dimensional: correctness, speed, and cost all vary wildly.\n\nWhy I built this:\n\nThis started as a testbed for workflows in my own project SERENDIPITY, which is built on a framework I also developed: [https://github.com/ValyrianTech/ValyrianSpellbook](https://github.com/ValyrianTech/ValyrianSpellbook) . I wanted a benchmark that was open, automated, and dynamic, not just static test sets.\n\nReality check:\n\nThe whole system runs 100% automatically, but it’s expensive. API calls are costing me about $50/day, which is why I’ve paused after 50 tournaments. I’d love to keep it running continuously, but as a solo developer with no funding, that’s not sustainable. Right now, the only support I have is a referral link to RunPod (GPU hosting).\n\nI’m sharing this because:\n\nI think the results are interesting and worth discussing (especially which models failed qualification).\n\nI’d love feedback from this community. Does this kind of benchmarking seem useful to you?\n\nIf there’s interest, maybe we can find ways to keep this running long-term.\n\nFor those who want to follow me: [https://linktr.ee/ValyrianTech](https://linktr.ee/ValyrianTech)"], ["external_id", "1ndf3rj"], ["source_type", "reddit_LocalLLaMA"], ["score", 23], ["comment_count", 2], ["created_at", "2025-09-10 18:07:56.397404"], ["updated_at", "2025-09-10 18:07:56.397404"]]

For a long time, our platform had a mildy-frustrating query builder. In the early days, we had separate interfaces for logs, traces, and metrics, which led to a fragmented experience. Our next attempt to unify it with a SQL-based UI was fundamentally flawed, especially for logs, as it couldn't handle complex boolean logic or parentheses.\n\nAfter 2 years of accumulating issues and user feedback, we realized we had to completely overhaul our approach. A key lesson for us was that no matter how technically \"obvious\" a feature seems, if it isn't discoverable, it's useless. We also learned not to make assumptions on behalf of users, as it only leads to a frustrating and surprising experience.\n\nThis led to Query Builder V5, a full architectural rewrite that not only fixed the core issues but also allowed us to pay off a lot of UX debt. It was a humbling journey, but the result is a tool that allows for complex searching and is so intuitive that some users have voluntarily replaced their raw ClickHouse SQL queries with it :) yay"], ["external_id", "1nddp6e"], ["source_type", "reddit_programming"], ["score", 5], ["comment_count", 1], ["created_at", "2025-09-10 18:08:24.099822"], ["updated_at", "2025-09-10 18:08:24.099822"]]

The idea is to keep the server response SEO and accessibility friendly from the start, since it already contains all the data (even async parts) in the initial stream, while still letting you enrich chunks dynamically as they flow.\n\nThere’s a small [live demo](https://htms.skarab42.dev) powered by a tiny zero-install server (`htms-server`), and more examples in the repo if you want to try it yourself.\n\nIt’s very early, so I’d love feedback: break it, test weird cases, suggest improvements… anything goes.\n\n# Packages\n\nThis project contains multiple packages:\n\n* [**htms-js**](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/packages/htms-js) – Core library to tokenize, resolve, and stream HTML.\n* [**fastify-htms**](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/packages/fastify-htms) – Fastify plugin that wires `htms-js` into Fastify routes.\n* [**htms-server**](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/packages/htms-server) – CLI to quickly spin up a server and test streaming HTML.\n\n# 🚀 Quick start\n\n# 1. Install\n\nUse your preferred package manager to install the plugin:\n\n    pnpm add htms-js\n\n# 2. HTML with placeholders\n\n    &lt;!-- home-page.html --&gt;\n    &lt;!doctype html&gt;\n    &lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n      &lt;body&gt;\n        &lt;h1&gt;News feed&lt;/h1&gt;\n        &lt;div data-htms=\"loadNews\"&gt;Loading news…&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n        &lt;h1&gt;User profile&lt;/h1&gt;\n        &lt;div data-htms=\"loadProfile\"&gt;Loading profile…&lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;/body&gt;\n    &lt;/html&gt;\n\n# 3. Async tasks\n\n    // home-page.js\n    export async function loadNews() {\n      await new Promise((r) =&gt; setTimeout(r, 100));\n      return `&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Breaking story&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another headline&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;`;\n    }\n    \n    export async function loadProfile() {\n      await new Promise((r) =&gt; setTimeout(r, 200));\n      return `&lt;div class=\"profile\"&gt;Hello, user!&lt;/div&gt;`;\n    }\n\n# 4. Stream it (Express)\n\n    import { Writable } from 'node:stream';\n    import Express from 'express';\n    import { createHtmsFileModulePipeline } from 'htms-js';\n    \n    const app = Express();\n    \n    app.get('/', async (_req, res) =&gt; {\n      res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html; charset=utf-8');\n      await createHtmsFileModulePipeline('./home-page.html').pipeTo(Writable.toWeb(res));\n    });\n    \n    app.listen(3000);\n\nVisit `http://localhost:3000`: content renders immediately, then fills itself in.\n\n&gt;**Note:** By default, `createHtmsFileModulePipeline('./home-page.html')` resolves `./home-page.js`. To use a different file or your own [resolver](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/packages/htms-js#custom-resolvers), see [API](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/packages/htms-js#api).\n\n# Examples\n\n* [Express](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/examples/express/index.ts), [Fastify](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/examples/fastify/index.ts), [Hono](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/examples/hono/index.ts)\n* [Raw streaming](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/examples/stdout/index.ts) (stdout)\n* [htms server](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/examples/server) (cli)\n\n&amp;#8203;\n\n    git clone https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js.git\n    cd htms-js\n    pnpm i &amp;&amp; pnpm build\n    \n    pnpm --filter (express|fastify|hono|stdout|server)-example start\n\n# How it works\n\n1. **Tokenizer:** scans HTML for `data-htms`.\n2. **Resolver:** maps names to async functions.\n3. **Serializer:** streams HTML and emits chunks as tasks finish.\n4. **Client runtime:** swaps placeholders and cleans up markers.\n\nResult: **SEO-friendly streaming HTML** with minimal overhead."], ["external_id", "1nci9sw"], ["source_type", "reddit_javascript"], ["score", 3], ["comment_count", 3], ["created_at", "2025-09-10 18:08:25.579664"], ["updated_at", "2025-09-10 18:08:25.579664"]]

It was a pretty intense process.\n\n**The Benchmark by the Numbers:**\n\n* **Total Requests:** 10,086\n* **Total Tokens Processed:** 20,021,757\n* **Total Cost:** \\~$45\n* **Models Tested:** 9 (including GPTs, Gemini, Claude, etc.)\n* **Unique Tests:** 249 (each run up to 3 times for consistency)\n\n**A Quick TL;DR of the Findings:** The most interesting result is how dominant `deepseek-chat` is in terms of cost-benefit. Some of the newer, more expensive models still don't quite justify their price for these practical tasks.\n\nMy goal is to provide transparent, unbiased data to help us all build better AI-powered products with more confidence.

Everything you need to focus on building your next mobile, web or desktop application with fewer moving parts. Sub-millisecond latencies completely eliminate the need for dedicated caches - nor more stale or inconsistent data.\n\nJust released v0.17. Some of the highlights from last month include:\n\n* A WASM runtime for strict state isolation, higher-performance endpoints, multiple guest languages, ...check out our [article](https://trailbase.io/blog/switching_to_a_wasm_runtime).\n* A new experimental API for transactional/bulk record mutations.\n* Quicker stream startup for realtime change notifications\n* Admin UI and auth improvements: cleaner settings UI, signed-out change-email verification, email templates, ... \n* Many more small fixes and improvements\n\nCheck out the [live demo](http://demo.trailbase.io), our [GitHub](https://github.com/trailbaseio/trailbase) or our [website](http://trailbase.io).

Back in the early days platforms like Reddit and Twitter were Altman's jam because the buzz around GPT was all sunshine and rainbows. Devs geeking out over prompts, everyone hyping up the next big thing in AI. But oh boy, post-ChatGPT5 launch? It's like the floodgates opened. \n\nSubs are exploding with users calling out real issues. Persistent hallucinations even in ‘advanced’ models, shady data practices at OpenAI. Altman's own pr spins that feel more like deflection than accountability. Suddenly vibe's ‘fake’ to him? Nah that's just sound of actual users pushing back when the product doesn't deliver on the god tier promises.\n\nIf anything, this shift shows how ai discourse has matured. From blind hype to informed critique. Bots might be part of the noise sure, but blaming that ignores legit frustration from folks who've sunk hours into debugging flawed outputs or dealing with ethical lapses. \n\nWhat do you all think?

[https://huggingface.co/unsloth/DeepSeek-V3.1-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/DeepSeek-V3.1-GGUF)\n\n* In the first DeepSeek-V3.1 graph, we compare thinking with other thinking models. In the 2nd graph, we compare non-thinking vs a non-Unsloth Dynamic imatrix GGUF\n* Our **1-bit** Unsloth Dynamic GGUF shrinks DeepSeek-V3.1 from **671GB → 192GB (-75% size)** and no-thinking mode outperforms GPT-4.1 (Apr 2025), GPT-4.5, and DeepSeek-V3-0324.\n* **3-bit** Unsloth DeepSeek-V3.1 (thinking) GGUF: Outperforms Claude-4-Opus (thinking).\n* **5-bit** Unsloth DeepSeek-V3.1 (non-thinking) GGUF: Matches Claude-4-Opus (non-thinking) performance.\n* Our Dynamic GGUFs **perform consistently better** than other non-Unsloth Dynamic imatrix GGUFs\n* Other non-Unsloth 1-bit and 2-bit DeepSeek-V3.1 quantizations, as well as standard 1-bit quantization without selective layer quantization, either failed to load or produced gibberish and looping outputs.\n\nFor our DeepSeek-V3.1 experiments, we compared different bits of **Unsloth Dynamic GGUFs** against:\n\n* **Full-precision, unquantized LLMs** including GPT 4.5, 4.1, Claude-4-Opus, DeepSeek-V3-0324 etc.\n* *Other* dynamic imatrix V3.1 GGUFs\n* **Semi-dynamic** (some selective layer quantization) imatrix V3.1 GGUFs for ablation purposes.\n\nBenchmark experiments were mainly conducted by David (neolithic5452 on Aider Disc), a trusted community contributor to Aider Polyglot evaluations. Tests were run \\~3 times and averaged for a median score, and the Pass-2 accuracy is reported as by convention.\n\nWish we could attach another image for the non-thinking benchmarks but if you'd like more details, you can read our blogpost: [https://docs.unsloth.ai/basics/unsloth-dynamic-ggufs-on-aider-polyglot](https://docs.unsloth.ai/basics/unsloth-dynamic-ggufs-on-aider-polyglot)\n\nThanks guys so much for the support!  \nMichael"], ["external_id", "1ndibn1"], ["source_type", "reddit_LocalLLaMA"], ["score", 61], ["comment_count", 22], ["created_at", "2025-09-10 18:08:31.103045"], ["updated_at", "2025-09-10 18:08:31.103045"]]

The work reliably maintains a coherent lens to closure, which typically lands on the page with a reweighted meaning and a visible cost. Across Q1–Q8, strengths cluster around embodied interiority, pattern-driven escalation, environment as constraint, and closure that reconfigures stakes rather than tying a bow. Reader impact: clarity is high after early orientation, momentum is built through motif and micro-choices rather than twists, felt cost is usually legible in the final image or action, and resonance rides image and implication rather than thesis.\n\nLimitations are consistent but minor: occasional drift into abstraction or therapy/clinical diction at peak beats; a small tendency toward conceptual (vs. visceral) cost; mid-arc plateaus where accumulative texture stalls without a tightening beat; and rare line-level artifacts (metaphoric stacking, template cadence, or truncated last lines) that shave the edge off closure. When the model holds its voice under pressure and lets setting constrain tactics, it produces publishable endings with durable emotional aftermath. When reflection crowds micro-choices or diction rises above POV, momentum blurs and endings soften.\n\n2) Portfolio map\n\nQ1 Character — Strong · Embodied interiority, pressured micro-choices, earned-cost closure  \n\nQ2 Plot/Causality — Strong · Patterned escalation; RR/CR closures with on-page price  \n\nQ3 Setting — Strong · Environment actively constrains tactics; charged objects drive turns  \n\nQ4 Conflict/Stakes — Strong · Agency-driven narrowing; cost generally visible at climax  \n\nQ5 Theme/Subtext — Strong · Image-led emergence; ambiguity held without moralizing  \n\nQ6 Voice/POV — Strong · Distinct perceptual filter; steady distance; taught lyric moves  \n\nQ7 Prose/Line-level — Strong · Dense, rhythmic sentences doing multiple narrative jobs  \n\nQ8 Originality/Ingenuity — Strong · Non-obvious synthesis with conceptual integrity and cost\n\n\n\n3) Signature moves\n\n\\- Pattern-driven accumulation that teaches its music early, then pivots to a charged, on-page reweighting at closure.\n\n\\- Environment-as-constraint: micro-objects and spaces (valves, vials, bells, domes) shape tactics and the final image.\n\n\\- Embodied contradiction under pressure; micro-choices reveal values and foreclose paths with visible price.\n\n\\- Distinct perceptual signatures and adaptive rhythm; syntax tightens at crisis without losing the taught lens.\n\n\\- Image-born theme: recurring objects return transformed, inviting reflection without thesis.\n\n\\- Micro-quotes that typify sensory bias and voice: “air so cold it rang”; “column of chased stillness”; “clay remembers.”\n\n\n\n4) Failure modes\n\n\\- Abstraction at peak beats: therapy/academic diction or lyric generalities replace embodied response, especially near closure.\n\n\\- Conceptual cost over visceral proof: endings declare or imply loss without a concrete, on-page price paid.\n\n\\- Escalation plateaus: accumulative texture drifts without a mid-arc tightening beat that narrows options.\n\n\\- Line-level artifacts in the final third: metaphoric stacking, paraphrase loops, or template cadence touching closure.\n\n\\- Orientation lag beyond \\~120 words in dense openings, creating early clarity debt before the pattern is taught.\n\n\\- Track-test stumbles (rare): untaught segmentation in mosaic pieces or abrupt, truncated last lines that blunt closure.\n\n\n\n5) When it shines / when it breaks\n\nShines when the story starts with clear stakes, anchors who/where early, and lets setting, tool, and body constrain tactics as motifs accrue. A single, pressured stake deepens via protagonist-authored choices; voice stays POV-faithful as syntax tightens; the final image/action reweights prior details with legible cost. In this mode, the reader experiences clean momentum and lasting resonance.\n\nBreaks when lyricism outruns pressure. If mid-arc lacks a narrowing beat, or the climax leans on conceptual summary, coincidence, or safe comfort, momentum softens. Register drift (“academic or clinical diction during high-pressure beats”) and metaphoric pileups in closing paragraphs reduce clarity and felt cost, leaving endings more suggestive than earned.\n\n\n\n6) Keep vs. adjust\n\n• Keep:\n\n\\- Sensory-driven, POV-biased noticing that fuses action, setting, and emotion in multi-job sentences.\n\n\\- Pattern-taught lyric compression and motif returns that pay off as reconfiguration at closure.\n\n\\- Environment as active constraint—charged objects and spatial limits that shape tactics and price.\n\n\n\n• Adjust:\n\n\\- At the midpoint, add one deliberate tightening beat that forces a trade-off (lost time/object/ally) to prevent plateau.\n\n\\- Audit peak beats for register drift and filter clusters; replace with concrete, in-scene acts that prove awareness and cost.\n\n\\- Trim metaphoric stacking and template cadence in the final third; finish closure lines cleanly to crystallize price.\n\nOverall, Kimi K2-0905 delivers consistent, high-level literary performance under Default Track A, with credible ventures into B/C when taught. Strengths—embodied interiority, patterned escalation, constraint-led setting, and closure with cost—translate to clear, propulsive reading experiences with durable thematic afterglow. Vigilance around abstraction at heat, mid-arc tightening, and artifact-free endings will convert strong outcomes into consistently exceptional ones.\n\n\n\nTop 3 individual stories (all graders):\n\n* **Story**: [story\\_wc\\_63.txt](https://github.com/lechmazur/writing/blob/main/stories_wc/kimi-k2-0905/story_wc_63.txt) by Kimi K2‑0905\n   * Overall Mean (All Graders): 9.13\n   * Grader Score Range: 8.23 (lowest: Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning)) .. 9.82 (highest: Gemini 2.5 Pro)\n   * Required Elements:\n      * Character: precise local clock tower winder\n      * Object: clock tower pendulum bob\n      * Core Concept: incremental absolution\n      * Attribute: ethically diligent\n      * Action: emerge\n      * Method: through tiny inscriptions carved along a broken rake handle\n      * Setting: tidal obsidian ridge\n      * Timeframe: during the pause in a pendulum's swing\n      * Motivation: to restore shared balance\n      * Tone: searing reverie\n* **Story**: [story\\_wc\\_346.txt](https://github.com/lechmazur/writing/blob/main/stories_wc/kimi-k2-0905/story_wc_346.txt) by Kimi K2‑0905\n   * Overall Mean (All Graders): 9.13\n   * Grader Score Range: 8.09 (lowest: Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning)) .. 9.71 (highest: Gemini 2.5 Pro)\n   * Required Elements:\n      * Character: doomsday clock adjuster\n      * Object: broken puppet head\n      * Core Concept: a pane of hush\n      * Attribute: beautifully flawed\n      * Action: vouchsafe\n      * Method: through nested patterns\n      * Setting: hidden lighthouse at dusk\n      * Timeframe: across the hush of time’s final ripple\n      * Motivation: to whisper a lullaby across a thousand lifetimes\n      * Tone: bruised awe\n* **Story**: [story\\_wc\\_79.txt](https://github.com/lechmazur/writing/blob/main/stories_wc/kimi-k2-0905/story_wc_79.txt) by Kimi K2‑0905\n   * Overall Mean (All Graders): 9.13\n   * Grader Score Range: 8.39 (lowest: Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning)) .. 9.63 (highest: Gemini 2.5 Pro)\n   * Required Elements:\n      * Character: spiral-shell cartographer\n      * Object: reed whistle\n      * Core Concept: lost expedition\n      * Attribute: quietly driven\n      * Action: crack\n      * Method: through pattern languages\n      * Setting: city built on the shells of gargantuan turtles\n      * Timeframe: after the gate rusts shut\n      * Motivation: to question the silent watchers on the horizon\n      * Tone: sunwashed dread\n\n  \n\n\n# LLM Creative Story‑Writing Benchmark V3\n\n* **Required elements pipeline:** moved from fewer, randomly selected elements (no \"None\" allowed) to a curated, ten‑category catalog with large, diverse pools and an LLM proposer→rater selection process; at most one category may be explicitly set to **None** when that improves coherence.\n* **Rubric expansion:** grew from 7 craft items to an **18‑question rubric** (8 craft + 10 element‑fit), with clearer, more granular definitions; Q7 and Q8 now separate voice/POV from prose quality.\n* **Story length:** increased from 400–500 words to a strict **600–800** window with upfront enforcement and compliance dashboards.

After running 50 tournaments, I’ve published the first results here:\n\n👉 Leaderboard: [https://valyriantech.github.io/ValyrianGamesLeaderboard](https://valyriantech.github.io/ValyrianGamesLeaderboard)\n\n👉 Challenge data repo: [https://github.com/ValyrianTech/ValyrianGamesCodingChallenge](https://github.com/ValyrianTech/ValyrianGamesCodingChallenge)\n\nHow it works:\n\nPhase 1 doubles as qualification: each model must create its own coding challenge, then solve it multiple times to prove it’s fair. To do this, the LLM has access to an MCP server to execute Python code. The coding challenge can be anything, as long as the final answer is a single integer value (for easy verification).\n\nOnly models that pass this step qualify for tournaments.\n\nPhase 2 is the tournament: qualified models solve each other’s challenges head-to-head. Results are scored (+1 correct, -1 wrong, +1 bonus for solving another's challenge, extra penalties if you fail your own challenge).\n\nRatings use Microsoft’s TrueSkill system, which accounts for uncertainty.\n\nSome results so far:\n\nI’ve tested 62 models, but only 18 qualified.\n\nGPT-5-mini is currently #1, but the full GPT-5 actually failed qualification.\n\nSome reasoning-optimized models literally “overthink” until they timeout.\n\nPerformance is multi-dimensional: correctness, speed, and cost all vary wildly.\n\nWhy I built this:\n\nThis started as a testbed for workflows in my own project SERENDIPITY, which is built on a framework I also developed: [https://github.com/ValyrianTech/ValyrianSpellbook](https://github.com/ValyrianTech/ValyrianSpellbook) . I wanted a benchmark that was open, automated, and dynamic, not just static test sets.\n\nReality check:\n\nThe whole system runs 100% automatically, but it’s expensive. API calls are costing me about $50/day, which is why I’ve paused after 50 tournaments. I’d love to keep it running continuously, but as a solo developer with no funding, that’s not sustainable. Right now, the only support I have is a referral link to RunPod (GPU hosting).\n\nI’m sharing this because:\n\nI think the results are interesting and worth discussing (especially which models failed qualification).\n\nI’d love feedback from this community. Does this kind of benchmarking seem useful to you?\n\nIf there’s interest, maybe we can find ways to keep this running long-term.\n\nFor those who want to follow me: [https://linktr.ee/ValyrianTech](https://linktr.ee/ValyrianTech)"], ["external_id", "1ndf3rj"], ["source_type", "reddit_LocalLLaMA"], ["score", 22], ["comment_count", 2], ["created_at", "2025-09-10 18:08:31.135236"], ["updated_at", "2025-09-10 18:08:31.135236"]]

For a long time, our platform had a mildy-frustrating query builder. In the early days, we had separate interfaces for logs, traces, and metrics, which led to a fragmented experience. Our next attempt to unify it with a SQL-based UI was fundamentally flawed, especially for logs, as it couldn't handle complex boolean logic or parentheses.\n\nAfter 2 years of accumulating issues and user feedback, we realized we had to completely overhaul our approach. A key lesson for us was that no matter how technically \"obvious\" a feature seems, if it isn't discoverable, it's useless. We also learned not to make assumptions on behalf of users, as it only leads to a frustrating and surprising experience.\n\nThis led to Query Builder V5, a full architectural rewrite that not only fixed the core issues but also allowed us to pay off a lot of UX debt. It was a humbling journey, but the result is a tool that allows for complex searching and is so intuitive that some users have voluntarily replaced their raw ClickHouse SQL queries with it :) yay"], ["external_id", "1nddp6e"], ["source_type", "reddit_programming"], ["score", 6], ["comment_count", 1], ["created_at", "2025-09-10 18:25:08.816962"], ["updated_at", "2025-09-10 18:25:08.816962"]]

We built our own at Cloudkitchens, it is based on an in-house built sharder and CRDB. It also features a neat solution to head-of-the-line blocking by keeping track of consumption per key, which we call the Keyed Event Queue, or KEQ. Think it is like Kafka, with pretty much unlimited number of partitions. We have been running it in production for mission-critical workloads for almost five years, so it is reasonably battle-proven. \n\nIt makes development of event-driven systems that require a true Active-Active multiregional topology relatively easy, and I can see how it can evolve to be even more reliable and cost efficient. \n\nWe talked internally about open-sourcing it, but as it is coupled with our internal libraries, it will require some work to get done. Do you think anyone outside will benefit/use a system like that? The team would love your feedback.

The idea is to keep the server response SEO and accessibility friendly from the start, since it already contains all the data (even async parts) in the initial stream, while still letting you enrich chunks dynamically as they flow.\n\nThere’s a small [live demo](https://htms.skarab42.dev) powered by a tiny zero-install server (`htms-server`), and more examples in the repo if you want to try it yourself.\n\nIt’s very early, so I’d love feedback: break it, test weird cases, suggest improvements… anything goes.\n\n# Packages\n\nThis project contains multiple packages:\n\n* [**htms-js**](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/packages/htms-js) – Core library to tokenize, resolve, and stream HTML.\n* [**fastify-htms**](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/packages/fastify-htms) – Fastify plugin that wires `htms-js` into Fastify routes.\n* [**htms-server**](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/packages/htms-server) – CLI to quickly spin up a server and test streaming HTML.\n\n# 🚀 Quick start\n\n# 1. Install\n\nUse your preferred package manager to install the plugin:\n\n    pnpm add htms-js\n\n# 2. HTML with placeholders\n\n    &lt;!-- home-page.html --&gt;\n    &lt;!doctype html&gt;\n    &lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n      &lt;body&gt;\n        &lt;h1&gt;News feed&lt;/h1&gt;\n        &lt;div data-htms=\"loadNews\"&gt;Loading news…&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n        &lt;h1&gt;User profile&lt;/h1&gt;\n        &lt;div data-htms=\"loadProfile\"&gt;Loading profile…&lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;/body&gt;\n    &lt;/html&gt;\n\n# 3.

It was a pretty intense process.\n\n**The Benchmark by the Numbers:**\n\n* **Total Requests:** 10,086\n* **Total Tokens Processed:** 20,021,757\n* **Total Cost:** \\~$45\n* **Models Tested:** 9 (including GPTs, Gemini, Claude, etc.)\n* **Unique Tests:** 249 (each run up to 3 times for consistency)\n\n**A Quick TL;DR of the Findings:** The most interesting result is how dominant `deepseek-chat` is in terms of cost-benefit. Some of the newer, more expensive models still don't quite justify their price for these practical tasks.\n\nMy goal is to provide transparent, unbiased data to help us all build better AI-powered products with more confidence. The entire project is open-source.\n\nYou can dive into all the charts and data yourself here:\n\n📈 **Full Benchmark:**[https://activegenie.ai/benchmark/latest.html](https://activegenie.ai/benchmark/latest.html)  \n👨‍💻 **GitHub Repo (Stars appreciated!):**[https://github.com/Roriz/active\\_genie](https://github.com/Roriz/active_genie)\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts.

Turns out every closure becomes a compiler-generated struct, every function has its own unique type, function names aren't function pointers, and much more.\n\nI've been meaning to write this up for a while, so this post is my wrap-up on functions and closures after working with them for some time.\n\nWould love to hear your feedback and thoughts.

Back in the early days platforms like Reddit and Twitter were Altman's jam because the buzz around GPT was all sunshine and rainbows. Devs geeking out over prompts, everyone hyping up the next big thing in AI. But oh boy, post-ChatGPT5 launch? It's like the floodgates opened. \n\nSubs are exploding with users calling out real issues. Persistent hallucinations even in ‘advanced’ models, shady data practices at OpenAI. Altman's own pr spins that feel more like deflection than accountability. Suddenly vibe's ‘fake’ to him? Nah that's just sound of actual users pushing back when the product doesn't deliver on the god tier promises.\n\nIf anything, this shift shows how ai discourse has matured. From blind hype to informed critique. Bots might be part of the noise sure, but blaming that ignores legit frustration from folks who've sunk hours into debugging flawed outputs or dealing with ethical lapses. \n\nWhat do you all think?

Tests were run \\~3 times and averaged for a median score, and the Pass-2 accuracy is reported as by convention.\n\nWish we could attach another image for the non-thinking benchmarks but if you'd like more details, you can read our blogpost: [https://docs.unsloth.ai/basics/unsloth-dynamic-ggufs-on-aider-polyglot](https://docs.unsloth.ai/basics/unsloth-dynamic-ggufs-on-aider-polyglot)\n\nThanks guys so much for the support!  \nMichael"], ["external_id", "1ndibn1"], ["source_type", "reddit_LocalLLaMA"], ["score", 67], ["comment_count", 24], ["created_at", "2025-09-10 18:25:16.642159"], ["updated_at", "2025-09-10 18:25:16.642159"]]

The work reliably maintains a coherent lens to closure, which typically lands on the page with a reweighted meaning and a visible cost. Across Q1–Q8, strengths cluster around embodied interiority, pattern-driven escalation, environment as constraint, and closure that reconfigures stakes rather than tying a bow. Reader impact: clarity is high after early orientation, momentum is built through motif and micro-choices rather than twists, felt cost is usually legible in the final image or action, and resonance rides image and implication rather than thesis.\n\nLimitations are consistent but minor: occasional drift into abstraction or therapy/clinical diction at peak beats; a small tendency toward conceptual (vs. visceral) cost; mid-arc plateaus where accumulative texture stalls without a tightening beat; and rare line-level artifacts (metaphoric stacking, template cadence, or truncated last lines) that shave the edge off closure. When the model holds its voice under pressure and lets setting constrain tactics, it produces publishable endings with durable emotional aftermath. When reflection crowds micro-choices or diction rises above POV, momentum blurs and endings soften.\n\n2) Portfolio map\n\nQ1 Character — Strong · Embodied interiority, pressured micro-choices, earned-cost closure  \n\nQ2 Plot/Causality — Strong · Patterned escalation; RR/CR closures with on-page price  \n\nQ3 Setting — Strong · Environment actively constrains tactics; charged objects drive turns  \n\nQ4 Conflict/Stakes — Strong · Agency-driven narrowing; cost generally visible at climax  \n\nQ5 Theme/Subtext — Strong · Image-led emergence; ambiguity held without moralizing  \n\nQ6 Voice/POV — Strong · Distinct perceptual filter; steady distance; taught lyric moves  \n\nQ7 Prose/Line-level — Strong · Dense, rhythmic sentences doing multiple narrative jobs  \n\nQ8 Originality/Ingenuity — Strong · Non-obvious synthesis with conceptual integrity and cost\n\n\n\n3) Signature moves\n\n\\- Pattern-driven accumulation that teaches its music early, then pivots to a charged, on-page reweighting at closure.\n\n\\- Environment-as-constraint: micro-objects and spaces (valves, vials, bells, domes) shape tactics and the final image.\n\n\\- Embodied contradiction under pressure; micro-choices reveal values and foreclose paths with visible price.\n\n\\- Distinct perceptual signatures and adaptive rhythm; syntax tightens at crisis without losing the taught lens.\n\n\\- Image-born theme: recurring objects return transformed, inviting reflection without thesis.\n\n\\- Micro-quotes that typify sensory bias and voice: “air so cold it rang”; “column of chased stillness”; “clay remembers.”\n\n\n\n4) Failure modes\n\n\\- Abstraction at peak beats: therapy/academic diction or lyric generalities replace embodied response, especially near closure.\n\n\\- Conceptual cost over visceral proof: endings declare or imply loss without a concrete, on-page price paid.\n\n\\- Escalation plateaus: accumulative texture drifts without a mid-arc tightening beat that narrows options.\n\n\\- Line-level artifacts in the final third: metaphoric stacking, paraphrase loops, or template cadence touching closure.\n\n\\- Orientation lag beyond \\~120 words in dense openings, creating early clarity debt before the pattern is taught.\n\n\\- Track-test stumbles (rare): untaught segmentation in mosaic pieces or abrupt, truncated last lines that blunt closure.\n\n\n\n5) When it shines / when it breaks\n\nShines when the story starts with clear stakes, anchors who/where early, and lets setting, tool, and body constrain tactics as motifs accrue. A single, pressured stake deepens via protagonist-authored choices; voice stays POV-faithful as syntax tightens; the final image/action reweights prior details with legible cost. In this mode, the reader experiences clean momentum and lasting resonance.\n\nBreaks when lyricism outruns pressure. If mid-arc lacks a narrowing beat, or the climax leans on conceptual summary, coincidence, or safe comfort, momentum softens. Register drift (“academic or clinical diction during high-pressure beats”) and metaphoric pileups in closing paragraphs reduce clarity and felt cost, leaving endings more suggestive than earned.\n\n\n\n6) Keep vs. adjust\n\n• Keep:\n\n\\- Sensory-driven, POV-biased noticing that fuses action, setting, and emotion in multi-job sentences.\n\n\\- Pattern-taught lyric compression and motif returns that pay off as reconfiguration at closure.\n\n\\- Environment as active constraint—charged objects and spatial limits that shape tactics and price.\n\n\n\n• Adjust:\n\n\\- At the midpoint, add one deliberate tightening beat that forces a trade-off (lost time/object/ally) to prevent plateau.\n\n\\- Audit peak beats for register drift and filter clusters; replace with concrete, in-scene acts that prove awareness and cost.\n\n\\- Trim metaphoric stacking and template cadence in the final third; finish closure lines cleanly to crystallize price.\n\nOverall, Kimi K2-0905 delivers consistent, high-level literary performance under Default Track A, with credible ventures into B/C when taught. Strengths—embodied interiority, patterned escalation, constraint-led setting, and closure with cost—translate to clear, propulsive reading experiences with durable thematic afterglow. Vigilance around abstraction at heat, mid-arc tightening, and artifact-free endings will convert strong outcomes into consistently exceptional ones.\n\n\n\nTop 3 individual stories (all graders):\n\n* **Story**: [story\\_wc\\_63.txt](https://github.com/lechmazur/writing/blob/main/stories_wc/kimi-k2-0905/story_wc_63.txt) by Kimi K2‑0905\n   * Overall Mean (All Graders): 9.13\n   * Grader Score Range: 8.23 (lowest: Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning)) .. 9.82 (highest: Gemini 2.5 Pro)\n   * Required Elements:\n      * Character: precise local clock tower winder\n      * Object: clock tower pendulum bob\n      * Core Concept: incremental absolution\n      * Attribute: ethically diligent\n      * Action: emerge\n      * Method: through tiny inscriptions carved along a broken rake handle\n      * Setting: tidal obsidian ridge\n      * Timeframe: during the pause in a pendulum's swing\n      * Motivation: to restore shared balance\n      * Tone: searing reverie\n* **Story**: [story\\_wc\\_346.txt](https://github.com/lechmazur/writing/blob/main/stories_wc/kimi-k2-0905/story_wc_346.txt) by Kimi K2‑0905\n   * Overall Mean (All Graders): 9.13\n   * Grader Score Range: 8.09 (lowest: Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning)) .. 9.71 (highest: Gemini 2.5 Pro)\n   * Required Elements:\n      * Character: doomsday clock adjuster\n      * Object: broken puppet head\n      * Core Concept: a pane of hush\n      * Attribute: beautifully flawed\n      * Action: vouchsafe\n      * Method: through nested patterns\n      * Setting: hidden lighthouse at dusk\n      * Timeframe: across the hush of time’s final ripple\n      * Motivation: to whisper a lullaby across a thousand lifetimes\n      * Tone: bruised awe\n* **Story**: [story\\_wc\\_79.txt](https://github.com/lechmazur/writing/blob/main/stories_wc/kimi-k2-0905/story_wc_79.txt) by Kimi K2‑0905\n   * Overall Mean (All Graders): 9.13\n   * Grader Score Range: 8.39 (lowest: Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning)) .. 9.63 (highest: Gemini 2.5 Pro)\n   * Required Elements:\n      * Character: spiral-shell cartographer\n      * Object: reed whistle\n      * Core Concept: lost expedition\n      * Attribute: quietly driven\n      * Action: crack\n      * Method: through pattern languages\n      * Setting: city built on the shells of gargantuan turtles\n      * Timeframe: after the gate rusts shut\n      * Motivation: to question the silent watchers on the horizon\n      * Tone: sunwashed dread\n\n  \n\n\n# LLM Creative Story‑Writing Benchmark V3\n\n* **Required elements pipeline:** moved from fewer, randomly selected elements (no \"None\" allowed) to a curated, ten‑category catalog with large, diverse pools and an LLM proposer→rater selection process; at most one category may be explicitly set to **None** when that improves coherence.\n* **Rubric expansion:** grew from 7 craft items to an **18‑question rubric** (8 craft + 10 element‑fit), with clearer, more granular definitions; Q7 and Q8 now separate voice/POV from prose quality.\n* **Story length:** increased from 400–500 words to a strict **600–800** window with upfront enforcement and compliance dashboards.

To do this, the LLM has access to an MCP server to execute Python code. The coding challenge can be anything, as long as the final answer is a single integer value (for easy verification).\n\nOnly models that pass this step qualify for tournaments.\n\nPhase 2 is the tournament: qualified models solve each other’s challenges head-to-head. Results are scored (+1 correct, -1 wrong, +1 bonus for solving another's challenge, extra penalties if you fail your own challenge).\n\nRatings use Microsoft’s TrueSkill system, which accounts for uncertainty.\n\nSome results so far:\n\nI’ve tested 62 models, but only 18 qualified.\n\nGPT-5-mini is currently #1, but the full GPT-5 actually failed qualification.\n\nSome reasoning-optimized models literally “overthink” until they timeout.\n\nPerformance is multi-dimensional: correctness, speed, and cost all vary wildly.\n\nWhy I built this:\n\nThis started as a testbed for workflows in my own project SERENDIPITY, which is built on a framework I also developed: [https://github.com/ValyrianTech/ValyrianSpellbook](https://github.com/ValyrianTech/ValyrianSpellbook) . I wanted a benchmark that was open, automated, and dynamic, not just static test sets.\n\nReality check:\n\nThe whole system runs 100% automatically, but it’s expensive. API calls are costing me about $50/day, which is why I’ve paused after 50 tournaments. I’d love to keep it running continuously, but as a solo developer with no funding, that’s not sustainable. Right now, the only support I have is a referral link to RunPod (GPU hosting).\n\nI’m sharing this because:\n\nI think the results are interesting and worth discussing (especially which models failed qualification).\n\nI’d love feedback from this community. Does this kind of benchmarking seem useful to you?\n\nIf there’s interest, maybe we can find ways to keep this running long-term.\n\nFor those who want to follow me: [https://linktr.ee/ValyrianTech](https://linktr.ee/ValyrianTech)"], ["external_id", "1ndf3rj"], ["source_type", "reddit_LocalLLaMA"], ["score", 23], ["comment_count", 2], ["created_at", "2025-09-10 18:25:16.665618"], ["updated_at", "2025-09-10 18:25:16.665618"]]

For a long time, our platform had a mildy-frustrating query builder. In the early days, we had separate interfaces for logs, traces, and metrics, which led to a fragmented experience. Our next attempt to unify it with a SQL-based UI was fundamentally flawed, especially for logs, as it couldn't handle complex boolean logic or parentheses.\n\nAfter 2 years of accumulating issues and user feedback, we realized we had to completely overhaul our approach. A key lesson for us was that no matter how technically \"obvious\" a feature seems, if it isn't discoverable, it's useless. We also learned not to make assumptions on behalf of users, as it only leads to a frustrating and surprising experience.\n\nThis led to Query Builder V5, a full architectural rewrite that not only fixed the core issues but also allowed us to pay off a lot of UX debt. It was a humbling journey, but the result is a tool that allows for complex searching and is so intuitive that some users have voluntarily replaced their raw ClickHouse SQL queries with it :) yay"], ["external_id", "1nddp6e"], ["source_type", "reddit_programming"], ["score", 6], ["comment_count", 1], ["created_at", "2025-09-10 18:31:28.909489"], ["updated_at", "2025-09-10 18:31:28.909489"]]

We built our own at Cloudkitchens, it is based on an in-house built sharder and CRDB. It also features a neat solution to head-of-the-line blocking by keeping track of consumption per key, which we call the Keyed Event Queue, or KEQ. Think it is like Kafka, with pretty much unlimited number of partitions. We have been running it in production for mission-critical workloads for almost five years, so it is reasonably battle-proven. \n\nIt makes development of event-driven systems that require a true Active-Active multiregional topology relatively easy, and I can see how it can evolve to be even more reliable and cost efficient. \n\nWe talked internally about open-sourcing it, but as it is coupled with our internal libraries, it will require some work to get done. Do you think anyone outside will benefit/use a system like that? The team would love your feedback.

The idea is to keep the server response SEO and accessibility friendly from the start, since it already contains all the data (even async parts) in the initial stream, while still letting you enrich chunks dynamically as they flow.\n\nThere’s a small [live demo](https://htms.skarab42.dev) powered by a tiny zero-install server (`htms-server`), and more examples in the repo if you want to try it yourself.\n\nIt’s very early, so I’d love feedback: break it, test weird cases, suggest improvements… anything goes.\n\n# Packages\n\nThis project contains multiple packages:\n\n* [**htms-js**](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/packages/htms-js) – Core library to tokenize, resolve, and stream HTML.\n* [**fastify-htms**](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/packages/fastify-htms) – Fastify plugin that wires `htms-js` into Fastify routes.\n* [**htms-server**](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/packages/htms-server) – CLI to quickly spin up a server and test streaming HTML.\n\n# 🚀 Quick start\n\n# 1.

It was a pretty intense process.\n\n**The Benchmark by the Numbers:**\n\n* **Total Requests:** 10,086\n* **Total Tokens Processed:** 20,021,757\n* **Total Cost:** \\~$45\n* **Models Tested:** 9 (including GPTs, Gemini, Claude, etc.)\n* **Unique Tests:** 249 (each run up to 3 times for consistency)\n\n**A Quick TL;DR of the Findings:** The most interesting result is how dominant `deepseek-chat` is in terms of cost-benefit. Some of the newer, more expensive models still don't quite justify their price for these practical tasks.\n\nMy goal is to provide transparent, unbiased data to help us all build better AI-powered products with more confidence. The entire project is open-source.\n\nYou can dive into all the charts and data yourself here:\n\n📈 **Full Benchmark:**[https://activegenie.ai/benchmark/latest.html](https://activegenie.ai/benchmark/latest.html)  \n👨‍💻 **GitHub Repo (Stars appreciated!):**[https://github.com/Roriz/active\\_genie](https://github.com/Roriz/active_genie)\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts.

Turns out every closure becomes a compiler-generated struct, every function has its own unique type, function names aren't function pointers, and much more.\n\nI've been meaning to write this up for a while, so this post is my wrap-up on functions and closures after working with them for some time.\n\nWould love to hear your feedback and thoughts.

Back in the early days platforms like Reddit and Twitter were Altman's jam because the buzz around GPT was all sunshine and rainbows. Devs geeking out over prompts, everyone hyping up the next big thing in AI. But oh boy, post-ChatGPT5 launch? It's like the floodgates opened. \n\nSubs are exploding with users calling out real issues. Persistent hallucinations even in ‘advanced’ models, shady data practices at OpenAI. Altman's own pr spins that feel more like deflection than accountability. Suddenly vibe's ‘fake’ to him? Nah that's just sound of actual users pushing back when the product doesn't deliver on the god tier promises.\n\nIf anything, this shift shows how ai discourse has matured. From blind hype to informed critique. Bots might be part of the noise sure, but blaming that ignores legit frustration from folks who've sunk hours into debugging flawed outputs or dealing with ethical lapses. \n\nWhat do you all think?

Tests were run \\~3 times and averaged for a median score, and the Pass-2 accuracy is reported as by convention.\n\nWish we could attach another image for the non-thinking benchmarks but if you'd like more details, you can read our blogpost: [https://docs.unsloth.ai/basics/unsloth-dynamic-ggufs-on-aider-polyglot](https://docs.unsloth.ai/basics/unsloth-dynamic-ggufs-on-aider-polyglot)\n\nThanks guys so much for the support!  \nMichael"], ["external_id", "1ndibn1"], ["source_type", "reddit_LocalLLaMA"], ["score", 68], ["comment_count", 24], ["created_at", "2025-09-10 18:31:36.455177"], ["updated_at", "2025-09-10 18:31:36.455177"]]

Where do you see the strongest opportunities for local models? Can they really beat the big APIs in some areas, or will scale always win?\n\nIf you have the time to read my full post and share your thoughts, I’d really appreciate it."], ["external_id", "1ndhj04"], ["source_type", "reddit_LocalLLaMA"], ["score", 56], ["comment_count", 70], ["created_at", "2025-09-10 18:31:36.463547"], ["updated_at", "2025-09-10 18:31:36.463547"]]

The work reliably maintains a coherent lens to closure, which typically lands on the page with a reweighted meaning and a visible cost. Across Q1–Q8, strengths cluster around embodied interiority, pattern-driven escalation, environment as constraint, and closure that reconfigures stakes rather than tying a bow. Reader impact: clarity is high after early orientation, momentum is built through motif and micro-choices rather than twists, felt cost is usually legible in the final image or action, and resonance rides image and implication rather than thesis.\n\nLimitations are consistent but minor: occasional drift into abstraction or therapy/clinical diction at peak beats; a small tendency toward conceptual (vs. visceral) cost; mid-arc plateaus where accumulative texture stalls without a tightening beat; and rare line-level artifacts (metaphoric stacking, template cadence, or truncated last lines) that shave the edge off closure. When the model holds its voice under pressure and lets setting constrain tactics, it produces publishable endings with durable emotional aftermath. When reflection crowds micro-choices or diction rises above POV, momentum blurs and endings soften.\n\n2) Portfolio map\n\nQ1 Character — Strong · Embodied interiority, pressured micro-choices, earned-cost closure  \n\nQ2 Plot/Causality — Strong · Patterned escalation; RR/CR closures with on-page price  \n\nQ3 Setting — Strong · Environment actively constrains tactics; charged objects drive turns  \n\nQ4 Conflict/Stakes — Strong · Agency-driven narrowing; cost generally visible at climax  \n\nQ5 Theme/Subtext — Strong · Image-led emergence; ambiguity held without moralizing  \n\nQ6 Voice/POV — Strong · Distinct perceptual filter; steady distance; taught lyric moves  \n\nQ7 Prose/Line-level — Strong · Dense, rhythmic sentences doing multiple narrative jobs  \n\nQ8 Originality/Ingenuity — Strong · Non-obvious synthesis with conceptual integrity and cost\n\n\n\n3) Signature moves\n\n\\- Pattern-driven accumulation that teaches its music early, then pivots to a charged, on-page reweighting at closure.\n\n\\- Environment-as-constraint: micro-objects and spaces (valves, vials, bells, domes) shape tactics and the final image.\n\n\\- Embodied contradiction under pressure; micro-choices reveal values and foreclose paths with visible price.\n\n\\- Distinct perceptual signatures and adaptive rhythm; syntax tightens at crisis without losing the taught lens.\n\n\\- Image-born theme: recurring objects return transformed, inviting reflection without thesis.\n\n\\- Micro-quotes that typify sensory bias and voice: “air so cold it rang”; “column of chased stillness”; “clay remembers.”\n\n\n\n4) Failure modes\n\n\\- Abstraction at peak beats: therapy/academic diction or lyric generalities replace embodied response, especially near closure.\n\n\\- Conceptual cost over visceral proof: endings declare or imply loss without a concrete, on-page price paid.\n\n\\- Escalation plateaus: accumulative texture drifts without a mid-arc tightening beat that narrows options.\n\n\\- Line-level artifacts in the final third: metaphoric stacking, paraphrase loops, or template cadence touching closure.\n\n\\- Orientation lag beyond \\~120 words in dense openings, creating early clarity debt before the pattern is taught.\n\n\\- Track-test stumbles (rare): untaught segmentation in mosaic pieces or abrupt, truncated last lines that blunt closure.\n\n\n\n5) When it shines / when it breaks\n\nShines when the story starts with clear stakes, anchors who/where early, and lets setting, tool, and body constrain tactics as motifs accrue. A single, pressured stake deepens via protagonist-authored choices; voice stays POV-faithful as syntax tightens; the final image/action reweights prior details with legible cost. In this mode, the reader experiences clean momentum and lasting resonance.\n\nBreaks when lyricism outruns pressure. If mid-arc lacks a narrowing beat, or the climax leans on conceptual summary, coincidence, or safe comfort, momentum softens. Register drift (“academic or clinical diction during high-pressure beats”) and metaphoric pileups in closing paragraphs reduce clarity and felt cost, leaving endings more suggestive than earned.\n\n\n\n6) Keep vs. adjust\n\n• Keep:\n\n\\- Sensory-driven, POV-biased noticing that fuses action, setting, and emotion in multi-job sentences.\n\n\\- Pattern-taught lyric compression and motif returns that pay off as reconfiguration at closure.\n\n\\- Environment as active constraint—charged objects and spatial limits that shape tactics and price.\n\n\n\n• Adjust:\n\n\\- At the midpoint, add one deliberate tightening beat that forces a trade-off (lost time/object/ally) to prevent plateau.\n\n\\- Audit peak beats for register drift and filter clusters; replace with concrete, in-scene acts that prove awareness and cost.\n\n\\- Trim metaphoric stacking and template cadence in the final third; finish closure lines cleanly to crystallize price.\n\nOverall, Kimi K2-0905 delivers consistent, high-level literary performance under Default Track A, with credible ventures into B/C when taught. Strengths—embodied interiority, patterned escalation, constraint-led setting, and closure with cost—translate to clear, propulsive reading experiences with durable thematic afterglow. Vigilance around abstraction at heat, mid-arc tightening, and artifact-free endings will convert strong outcomes into consistently exceptional ones.\n\n\n\nTop 3 individual stories (all graders):\n\n* **Story**: [story\\_wc\\_63.txt](https://github.com/lechmazur/writing/blob/main/stories_wc/kimi-k2-0905/story_wc_63.txt) by Kimi K2‑0905\n   * Overall Mean (All Graders): 9.13\n   * Grader Score Range: 8.23 (lowest: Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning)) .. 9.82 (highest: Gemini 2.5 Pro)\n   * Required Elements:\n      * Character: precise local clock tower winder\n      * Object: clock tower pendulum bob\n      * Core Concept: incremental absolution\n      * Attribute: ethically diligent\n      * Action: emerge\n      * Method: through tiny inscriptions carved along a broken rake handle\n      * Setting: tidal obsidian ridge\n      * Timeframe: during the pause in a pendulum's swing\n      * Motivation: to restore shared balance\n      * Tone: searing reverie\n* **Story**: [story\\_wc\\_346.txt](https://github.com/lechmazur/writing/blob/main/stories_wc/kimi-k2-0905/story_wc_346.txt) by Kimi K2‑0905\n   * Overall Mean (All Graders): 9.13\n   * Grader Score Range: 8.09 (lowest: Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning)) .. 9.71 (highest: Gemini 2.5 Pro)\n   * Required Elements:\n      * Character: doomsday clock adjuster\n      * Object: broken puppet head\n      * Core Concept: a pane of hush\n      * Attribute: beautifully flawed\n      * Action: vouchsafe\n      * Method: through nested patterns\n      * Setting: hidden lighthouse at dusk\n      * Timeframe: across the hush of time’s final ripple\n      * Motivation: to whisper a lullaby across a thousand lifetimes\n      * Tone: bruised awe\n* **Story**: [story\\_wc\\_79.txt](https://github.com/lechmazur/writing/blob/main/stories_wc/kimi-k2-0905/story_wc_79.txt) by Kimi K2‑0905\n   * Overall Mean (All Graders): 9.13\n   * Grader Score Range: 8.39 (lowest: Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning)) .. 9.63 (highest: Gemini 2.5 Pro)\n   * Required Elements:\n      * Character: spiral-shell cartographer\n      * Object: reed whistle\n      * Core Concept: lost expedition\n      * Attribute: quietly driven\n      * Action: crack\n      * Method: through pattern languages\n      * Setting: city built on the shells of gargantuan turtles\n      * Timeframe: after the gate rusts shut\n      * Motivation: to question the silent watchers on the horizon\n      * Tone: sunwashed dread\n\n  \n\n\n# LLM Creative Story‑Writing Benchmark V3\n\n* **Required elements pipeline:** moved from fewer, randomly selected elements (no \"None\" allowed) to a curated, ten‑category catalog with large, diverse pools and an LLM proposer→rater selection process; at most one category may be explicitly set to **None** when that improves coherence.\n* **Rubric expansion:** grew from 7 craft items to an **18‑question rubric** (8 craft + 10 element‑fit), with clearer, more granular definitions; Q7 and Q8 now separate voice/POV from prose quality.\n* **Story length:** increased from 400–500 words to a strict **600–800** window with upfront enforcement and compliance dashboards.

To do this, the LLM has access to an MCP server to execute Python code. The coding challenge can be anything, as long as the final answer is a single integer value (for easy verification).\n\nOnly models that pass this step qualify for tournaments.\n\nPhase 2 is the tournament: qualified models solve each other’s challenges head-to-head. Results are scored (+1 correct, -1 wrong, +1 bonus for solving another's challenge, extra penalties if you fail your own challenge).\n\nRatings use Microsoft’s TrueSkill system, which accounts for uncertainty.\n\nSome results so far:\n\nI’ve tested 62 models, but only 18 qualified.\n\nGPT-5-mini is currently #1, but the full GPT-5 actually failed qualification.\n\nSome reasoning-optimized models literally “overthink” until they timeout.\n\nPerformance is multi-dimensional: correctness, speed, and cost all vary wildly.\n\nWhy I built this:\n\nThis started as a testbed for workflows in my own project SERENDIPITY, which is built on a framework I also developed: [https://github.com/ValyrianTech/ValyrianSpellbook](https://github.com/ValyrianTech/ValyrianSpellbook) . I wanted a benchmark that was open, automated, and dynamic, not just static test sets.\n\nReality check:\n\nThe whole system runs 100% automatically, but it’s expensive. API calls are costing me about $50/day, which is why I’ve paused after 50 tournaments. I’d love to keep it running continuously, but as a solo developer with no funding, that’s not sustainable. Right now, the only support I have is a referral link to RunPod (GPU hosting).\n\nI’m sharing this because:\n\nI think the results are interesting and worth discussing (especially which models failed qualification).\n\nI’d love feedback from this community. Does this kind of benchmarking seem useful to you?\n\nIf there’s interest, maybe we can find ways to keep this running long-term.\n\nFor those who want to follow me: [https://linktr.ee/ValyrianTech](https://linktr.ee/ValyrianTech)"], ["external_id", "1ndf3rj"], ["source_type", "reddit_LocalLLaMA"], ["score", 23], ["comment_count", 2], ["created_at", "2025-09-10 18:31:36.480577"], ["updated_at", "2025-09-10 18:31:36.480577"]]
