For a long time, our platform had a mildy-frustrating query builder. In the early days, we had separate interfaces for logs, traces, and metrics, which led to a fragmented experience. Our next attempt to unify it with a SQL-based UI was fundamentally flawed, especially for logs, as it couldn't handle complex boolean logic or parentheses.\n\nAfter 2 years of accumulating issues and user feedback, we realized we had to completely overhaul our approach. A key lesson for us was that no matter how technically \"obvious\" a feature seems, if it isn't discoverable, it's useless. We also learned not to make assumptions on behalf of users, as it only leads to a frustrating and surprising experience.\n\nThis led to Query Builder V5, a full architectural rewrite that not only fixed the core issues but also allowed us to pay off a lot of UX debt. It was a humbling journey, but the result is a tool that allows for complex searching and is so intuitive that some users have voluntarily replaced their raw ClickHouse SQL queries with it :) yay"], ["external_id", "1nddp6e"], ["source_type", "reddit_programming"], ["score", 3], ["comment_count", 1], ["created_at", "2025-09-10 15:04:23.425088"], ["updated_at", "2025-09-10 15:04:23.425088"]]

My goal was to create a lean alternative to traditional, resource-heavy PDF solutions.\n\n# Core Technical Design\n\nThe core of the service is built on **Go 1.23+** and the **Gin framework** for their high performance and concurrency capabilities. Unlike many other services that rely on disk-based processing, GoPdfSuit is a **high-performance in-memory PDF generator**. This approach is crucial to its speed, as it completely bypasses slow disk I/O operations, leading to ultra-fast response times of sub-millisecond to low-millisecond.\n\nFor the actual HTML-to-PDF and HTML-to-image conversions, the service leverages the power of `wkhtmltopdf` and `wkhtmltoimage`. This allows it to accurately render web pages and HTML snippets into high-quality PDFs and images. The project demonstrates how intelligently integrating and managing a powerful external tool like `wkhtmltopdf` can lead to a highly optimized and performant solution.\n\n# Key Features and Implementation Details\n\n* **Template-Driven System**: GoPdfSuit utilizes a **JSON-driven templating system**. This design separates data from presentation, making it simple to generate complex, dynamic PDFs by just sending a JSON payload to the REST API.\n* **Flexible PDF Generation**: The service supports multi-page documents with automatic page breaks and custom page sizes, giving developers a high degree of control over the output. It also includes support for **AcroForm** and **XFDF data**, enabling the filling out of interactive forms programmatically.\n* **Deployment**: It's deployed as a single, statically compiled binary, making it extremely easy to get up and running in any environment, from a local machine to a containerized cloud deployment.\n\nI'm happy to discuss the implementation details, the challenges of orchestrating `wkhtmltopdf` in a high-concurrency environment, or the design of the in-memory processing pipeline.\n\n* **GitHub**: [`https://github.com/chinmay-sawant/gopdfsuit`](https://github.com/chinmay-sawant/gopdfsuit)\n* **Project Page**: [`https://chinmay-sawant.github.io/gopdfsuit/`](https://chinmay-sawant.github.io/gopdfsuit/)"], ["external_id", "1ncl9ws"], ["source_type", "reddit_programming"], ["score", 2], ["comment_count", 6], ["created_at", "2025-09-10 15:04:23.468719"], ["updated_at", "2025-09-10 15:04:23.468719"]]

The idea is to keep the server response SEO and accessibility friendly from the start, since it already contains all the data (even async parts) in the initial stream, while still letting you enrich chunks dynamically as they flow.\n\nThere’s a small [live demo](https://htms.skarab42.dev) powered by a tiny zero-install server (`htms-server`), and more examples in the repo if you want to try it yourself.\n\nIt’s very early, so I’d love feedback: break it, test weird cases, suggest improvements… anything goes.\n\n# Packages\n\nThis project contains multiple packages:\n\n* [**htms-js**](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/packages/htms-js) – Core library to tokenize, resolve, and stream HTML.\n* [**fastify-htms**](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/packages/fastify-htms) – Fastify plugin that wires `htms-js` into Fastify routes.\n* [**htms-server**](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/packages/htms-server) – CLI to quickly spin up a server and test streaming HTML.\n\n# 🚀 Quick start\n\n# 1. Install\n\nUse your preferred package manager to install the plugin:\n\n    pnpm add htms-js\n\n# 2. HTML with placeholders\n\n    &lt;!-- home-page.html --&gt;\n    &lt;!doctype html&gt;\n    &lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n      &lt;body&gt;\n        &lt;h1&gt;News feed&lt;/h1&gt;\n        &lt;div data-htms=\"loadNews\"&gt;Loading news…&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n        &lt;h1&gt;User profile&lt;/h1&gt;\n        &lt;div data-htms=\"loadProfile\"&gt;Loading profile…&lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;/body&gt;\n    &lt;/html&gt;\n\n# 3. Async tasks\n\n    // home-page.js\n    export async function loadNews() {\n      await new Promise((r) =&gt; setTimeout(r, 100));\n      return `&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Breaking story&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another headline&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;`;\n    }\n    \n    export async function loadProfile() {\n      await new Promise((r) =&gt; setTimeout(r, 200));\n      return `&lt;div class=\"profile\"&gt;Hello, user!&lt;/div&gt;`;\n    }\n\n# 4. Stream it (Express)\n\n    import { Writable } from 'node:stream';\n    import Express from 'express';\n    import { createHtmsFileModulePipeline } from 'htms-js';\n    \n    const app = Express();\n    \n    app.get('/', async (_req, res) =&gt; {\n      res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html; charset=utf-8');\n      await createHtmsFileModulePipeline('./home-page.html').pipeTo(Writable.toWeb(res));\n    });\n    \n    app.listen(3000);\n\nVisit `http://localhost:3000`: content renders immediately, then fills itself in.\n\n&gt;**Note:** By default, `createHtmsFileModulePipeline('./home-page.html')` resolves `./home-page.js`. To use a different file or your own [resolver](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/packages/htms-js#custom-resolvers), see [API](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/packages/htms-js#api).\n\n# Examples\n\n* [Express](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/examples/express/index.ts), [Fastify](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/examples/fastify/index.ts), [Hono](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/examples/hono/index.ts)\n* [Raw streaming](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/examples/stdout/index.ts) (stdout)\n* [htms server](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/examples/server) (cli)\n\n&amp;#8203;\n\n    git clone https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js.git\n    cd htms-js\n    pnpm i &amp;&amp; pnpm build\n    \n    pnpm --filter (express|fastify|hono|stdout|server)-example start\n\n# How it works\n\n1. **Tokenizer:** scans HTML for `data-htms`.\n2. **Resolver:** maps names to async functions.\n3. **Serializer:** streams HTML and emits chunks as tasks finish.\n4. **Client runtime:** swaps placeholders and cleans up markers.\n\nResult: **SEO-friendly streaming HTML** with minimal overhead."], ["external_id", "1nci9sw"], ["source_type", "reddit_javascript"], ["score", 3], ["comment_count", 3], ["created_at", "2025-09-10 15:04:24.951219"], ["updated_at", "2025-09-10 15:04:24.951219"]]

It was a pretty intense process.\n\n**The Benchmark by the Numbers:**\n\n* **Total Requests:** 10,086\n* **Total Tokens Processed:** 20,021,757\n* **Total Cost:** \\~$45\n* **Models Tested:** 9 (including GPTs, Gemini, Claude, etc.)\n* **Unique Tests:** 249 (each run up to 3 times for consistency)\n\n**A Quick TL;DR of the Findings:** The most interesting result is how dominant `deepseek-chat` is in terms of cost-benefit. Some of the newer, more expensive models still don't quite justify their price for these practical tasks.\n\nMy goal is to provide transparent, unbiased data to help us all build better AI-powered products with more confidence. The entire project is open-source.\n\nYou can dive into all the charts and data yourself here:\n\n📈 **Full Benchmark:**[https://activegenie.ai/benchmark/latest.html](https://activegenie.ai/benchmark/latest.html)  \n👨‍💻 **GitHub Repo (Stars appreciated!):**[https://github.com/Roriz/active\\_genie](https://github.com/Roriz/active_genie)\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts.

Everything you need to focus on building your next mobile, web or desktop application with fewer moving parts. Sub-millisecond latencies completely eliminate the need for dedicated caches - nor more stale or inconsistent data.\n\nJust released v0.17. Some of the highlights from last month include:\n\n* A WASM runtime for strict state isolation, higher-performance endpoints, multiple guest languages, ...check out our [article](https://trailbase.io/blog/switching_to_a_wasm_runtime).\n* A new experimental API for transactional/bulk record mutations.\n* Quicker stream startup for realtime change notifications\n* Admin UI and auth improvements: cleaner settings UI, signed-out change-email verification, email templates, ... \n* Many more small fixes and improvements\n\nCheck out the [live demo](http://demo.trailbase.io), our [GitHub](https://github.com/trailbaseio/trailbase) or our [website](http://trailbase.io).

Back in the early days platforms like Reddit and Twitter were Altman's jam because the buzz around GPT was all sunshine and rainbows. Devs geeking out over prompts, everyone hyping up the next big thing in AI. But oh boy, post-ChatGPT5 launch? It's like the floodgates opened. \n\nSubs are exploding with users calling out real issues. Persistent hallucinations even in ‘advanced’ models, shady data practices at OpenAI.

Nah that's just sound of actual users pushing back when the product doesn't deliver on the god tier promises.\n\nIf anything, this shift shows how ai discourse has matured. From blind hype to informed critique. Bots might be part of the noise sure, but blaming that ignores legit frustration from folks who've sunk hours into debugging flawed outputs or dealing with ethical lapses. \n\nWhat do you all think?

After running 50 tournaments, I’ve published the first results here:\n\n👉 Leaderboard: [https://valyriantech.github.io/ValyrianGamesLeaderboard](https://valyriantech.github.io/ValyrianGamesLeaderboard)\n\n👉 Challenge data repo: [https://github.com/ValyrianTech/ValyrianGamesCodingChallenge](https://github.com/ValyrianTech/ValyrianGamesCodingChallenge)\n\nHow it works:\n\nPhase 1 doubles as qualification: each model must create its own coding challenge, then solve it multiple times to prove it’s fair. To do this, the LLM has access to an MCP server to execute Python code. The coding challenge can be anything, as long as the final answer is a single integer value (for easy verification).\n\nOnly models that pass this step qualify for tournaments.\n\nPhase 2 is the tournament: qualified models solve each other’s challenges head-to-head. Results are scored (+1 correct, -1 wrong, +1 bonus for solving another's challenge, extra penalties if you fail your own challenge).\n\nRatings use Microsoft’s TrueSkill system, which accounts for uncertainty.\n\nSome results so far:\n\nI’ve tested 62 models, but only 18 qualified.\n\nGPT-5-mini is currently #1, but the full GPT-5 actually failed qualification.\n\nSome reasoning-optimized models literally “overthink” until they timeout.\n\nPerformance is multi-dimensional: correctness, speed, and cost all vary wildly.\n\nWhy I built this:\n\nThis started as a testbed for workflows in my own project SERENDIPITY, which is built on a framework I also developed: [https://github.com/ValyrianTech/ValyrianSpellbook](https://github.com/ValyrianTech/ValyrianSpellbook) . I wanted a benchmark that was open, automated, and dynamic, not just static test sets.\n\nReality check:\n\nThe whole system runs 100% automatically, but it’s expensive. API calls are costing me about $50/day, which is why I’ve paused after 50 tournaments. I’d love to keep it running continuously, but as a solo developer with no funding, that’s not sustainable. Right now, the only support I have is a referral link to RunPod (GPU hosting).\n\nI’m sharing this because:\n\nI think the results are interesting and worth discussing (especially which models failed qualification).\n\nI’d love feedback from this community. Does this kind of benchmarking seem useful to you?\n\nIf there’s interest, maybe we can find ways to keep this running long-term.\n\nFor those who want to follow me: [https://linktr.ee/ValyrianTech](https://linktr.ee/ValyrianTech)"], ["external_id", "1ndf3rj"], ["source_type", "reddit_LocalLLaMA"], ["score", 8], ["comment_count", 1], ["created_at", "2025-09-10 15:04:31.053079"], ["updated_at", "2025-09-10 15:04:31.053079"]]

For a long time, our platform had a mildy-frustrating query builder. In the early days, we had separate interfaces for logs, traces, and metrics, which led to a fragmented experience. Our next attempt to unify it with a SQL-based UI was fundamentally flawed, especially for logs, as it couldn't handle complex boolean logic or parentheses.\n\nAfter 2 years of accumulating issues and user feedback, we realized we had to completely overhaul our approach. A key lesson for us was that no matter how technically \"obvious\" a feature seems, if it isn't discoverable, it's useless. We also learned not to make assumptions on behalf of users, as it only leads to a frustrating and surprising experience.\n\nThis led to Query Builder V5, a full architectural rewrite that not only fixed the core issues but also allowed us to pay off a lot of UX debt. It was a humbling journey, but the result is a tool that allows for complex searching and is so intuitive that some users have voluntarily replaced their raw ClickHouse SQL queries with it :) yay"], ["external_id", "1nddp6e"], ["source_type", "reddit_programming"], ["score", 2], ["comment_count", 1], ["created_at", "2025-09-10 15:06:34.840967"], ["updated_at", "2025-09-10 15:06:34.840967"]]

My goal was to create a lean alternative to traditional, resource-heavy PDF solutions.\n\n# Core Technical Design\n\nThe core of the service is built on **Go 1.23+** and the **Gin framework** for their high performance and concurrency capabilities. Unlike many other services that rely on disk-based processing, GoPdfSuit is a **high-performance in-memory PDF generator**. This approach is crucial to its speed, as it completely bypasses slow disk I/O operations, leading to ultra-fast response times of sub-millisecond to low-millisecond.\n\nFor the actual HTML-to-PDF and HTML-to-image conversions, the service leverages the power of `wkhtmltopdf` and `wkhtmltoimage`. This allows it to accurately render web pages and HTML snippets into high-quality PDFs and images. The project demonstrates how intelligently integrating and managing a powerful external tool like `wkhtmltopdf` can lead to a highly optimized and performant solution.\n\n# Key Features and Implementation Details\n\n* **Template-Driven System**: GoPdfSuit utilizes a **JSON-driven templating system**. This design separates data from presentation, making it simple to generate complex, dynamic PDFs by just sending a JSON payload to the REST API.\n* **Flexible PDF Generation**: The service supports multi-page documents with automatic page breaks and custom page sizes, giving developers a high degree of control over the output. It also includes support for **AcroForm** and **XFDF data**, enabling the filling out of interactive forms programmatically.\n* **Deployment**: It's deployed as a single, statically compiled binary, making it extremely easy to get up and running in any environment, from a local machine to a containerized cloud deployment.\n\nI'm happy to discuss the implementation details, the challenges of orchestrating `wkhtmltopdf` in a high-concurrency environment, or the design of the in-memory processing pipeline.\n\n* **GitHub**: [`https://github.com/chinmay-sawant/gopdfsuit`](https://github.com/chinmay-sawant/gopdfsuit)\n* **Project Page**: [`https://chinmay-sawant.github.io/gopdfsuit/`](https://chinmay-sawant.github.io/gopdfsuit/)"], ["external_id", "1ncl9ws"], ["source_type", "reddit_programming"], ["score", 2], ["comment_count", 6], ["created_at", "2025-09-10 15:06:34.884667"], ["updated_at", "2025-09-10 15:06:34.884667"]]

The idea is to keep the server response SEO and accessibility friendly from the start, since it already contains all the data (even async parts) in the initial stream, while still letting you enrich chunks dynamically as they flow.\n\nThere’s a small [live demo](https://htms.skarab42.dev) powered by a tiny zero-install server (`htms-server`), and more examples in the repo if you want to try it yourself.\n\nIt’s very early, so I’d love feedback: break it, test weird cases, suggest improvements… anything goes.\n\n# Packages\n\nThis project contains multiple packages:\n\n* [**htms-js**](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/packages/htms-js) – Core library to tokenize, resolve, and stream HTML.\n* [**fastify-htms**](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/packages/fastify-htms) – Fastify plugin that wires `htms-js` into Fastify routes.\n* [**htms-server**](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/packages/htms-server) – CLI to quickly spin up a server and test streaming HTML.\n\n# 🚀 Quick start\n\n# 1. Install\n\nUse your preferred package manager to install the plugin:\n\n    pnpm add htms-js\n\n# 2. HTML with placeholders\n\n    &lt;!-- home-page.html --&gt;\n    &lt;!doctype html&gt;\n    &lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n      &lt;body&gt;\n        &lt;h1&gt;News feed&lt;/h1&gt;\n        &lt;div data-htms=\"loadNews\"&gt;Loading news…&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n        &lt;h1&gt;User profile&lt;/h1&gt;\n        &lt;div data-htms=\"loadProfile\"&gt;Loading profile…&lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;/body&gt;\n    &lt;/html&gt;\n\n# 3. Async tasks\n\n    // home-page.js\n    export async function loadNews() {\n      await new Promise((r) =&gt; setTimeout(r, 100));\n      return `&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Breaking story&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another headline&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;`;\n    }\n    \n    export async function loadProfile() {\n      await new Promise((r) =&gt; setTimeout(r, 200));\n      return `&lt;div class=\"profile\"&gt;Hello, user!&lt;/div&gt;`;\n    }\n\n# 4. Stream it (Express)\n\n    import { Writable } from 'node:stream';\n    import Express from 'express';\n    import { createHtmsFileModulePipeline } from 'htms-js';\n    \n    const app = Express();\n    \n    app.get('/', async (_req, res) =&gt; {\n      res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html; charset=utf-8');\n      await createHtmsFileModulePipeline('./home-page.html').pipeTo(Writable.toWeb(res));\n    });\n    \n    app.listen(3000);\n\nVisit `http://localhost:3000`: content renders immediately, then fills itself in.\n\n&gt;**Note:** By default, `createHtmsFileModulePipeline('./home-page.html')` resolves `./home-page.js`. To use a different file or your own [resolver](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/packages/htms-js#custom-resolvers), see [API](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/packages/htms-js#api).\n\n# Examples\n\n* [Express](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/examples/express/index.ts), [Fastify](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/examples/fastify/index.ts), [Hono](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/examples/hono/index.ts)\n* [Raw streaming](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/examples/stdout/index.ts) (stdout)\n* [htms server](https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js/tree/main/examples/server) (cli)\n\n&amp;#8203;\n\n    git clone https://github.com/skarab42/htms-js.git\n    cd htms-js\n    pnpm i &amp;&amp; pnpm build\n    \n    pnpm --filter (express|fastify|hono|stdout|server)-example start\n\n# How it works\n\n1. **Tokenizer:** scans HTML for `data-htms`.\n2. **Resolver:** maps names to async functions.\n3. **Serializer:** streams HTML and emits chunks as tasks finish.\n4. **Client runtime:** swaps placeholders and cleans up markers.\n\nResult: **SEO-friendly streaming HTML** with minimal overhead."], ["external_id", "1nci9sw"], ["source_type", "reddit_javascript"], ["score", 5], ["comment_count", 3], ["created_at", "2025-09-10 15:06:36.450025"], ["updated_at", "2025-09-10 15:06:36.450025"]]

It was a pretty intense process.\n\n**The Benchmark by the Numbers:**\n\n* **Total Requests:** 10,086\n* **Total Tokens Processed:** 20,021,757\n* **Total Cost:** \\~$45\n* **Models Tested:** 9 (including GPTs, Gemini, Claude, etc.)\n* **Unique Tests:** 249 (each run up to 3 times for consistency)\n\n**A Quick TL;DR of the Findings:** The most interesting result is how dominant `deepseek-chat` is in terms of cost-benefit. Some of the newer, more expensive models still don't quite justify their price for these practical tasks.\n\nMy goal is to provide transparent, unbiased data to help us all build better AI-powered products with more confidence.

Nah that's just sound of actual users pushing back when the product doesn't deliver on the god tier promises.\n\nIf anything, this shift shows how ai discourse has matured. From blind hype to informed critique. Bots might be part of the noise sure, but blaming that ignores legit frustration from folks who've sunk hours into debugging flawed outputs or dealing with ethical lapses. \n\nWhat do you all think?

After running 50 tournaments, I’ve published the first results here:\n\n👉 Leaderboard: [https://valyriantech.github.io/ValyrianGamesLeaderboard](https://valyriantech.github.io/ValyrianGamesLeaderboard)\n\n👉 Challenge data repo: [https://github.com/ValyrianTech/ValyrianGamesCodingChallenge](https://github.com/ValyrianTech/ValyrianGamesCodingChallenge)\n\nHow it works:\n\nPhase 1 doubles as qualification: each model must create its own coding challenge, then solve it multiple times to prove it’s fair. To do this, the LLM has access to an MCP server to execute Python code. The coding challenge can be anything, as long as the final answer is a single integer value (for easy verification).\n\nOnly models that pass this step qualify for tournaments.\n\nPhase 2 is the tournament: qualified models solve each other’s challenges head-to-head. Results are scored (+1 correct, -1 wrong, +1 bonus for solving another's challenge, extra penalties if you fail your own challenge).\n\nRatings use Microsoft’s TrueSkill system, which accounts for uncertainty.\n\nSome results so far:\n\nI’ve tested 62 models, but only 18 qualified.\n\nGPT-5-mini is currently #1, but the full GPT-5 actually failed qualification.\n\nSome reasoning-optimized models literally “overthink” until they timeout.\n\nPerformance is multi-dimensional: correctness, speed, and cost all vary wildly.\n\nWhy I built this:\n\nThis started as a testbed for workflows in my own project SERENDIPITY, which is built on a framework I also developed: [https://github.com/ValyrianTech/ValyrianSpellbook](https://github.com/ValyrianTech/ValyrianSpellbook) . I wanted a benchmark that was open, automated, and dynamic, not just static test sets.\n\nReality check:\n\nThe whole system runs 100% automatically, but it’s expensive. API calls are costing me about $50/day, which is why I’ve paused after 50 tournaments. I’d love to keep it running continuously, but as a solo developer with no funding, that’s not sustainable. Right now, the only support I have is a referral link to RunPod (GPU hosting).\n\nI’m sharing this because:\n\nI think the results are interesting and worth discussing (especially which models failed qualification).\n\nI’d love feedback from this community. Does this kind of benchmarking seem useful to you?\n\nIf there’s interest, maybe we can find ways to keep this running long-term.\n\nFor those who want to follow me: [https://linktr.ee/ValyrianTech](https://linktr.ee/ValyrianTech)"], ["external_id", "1ndf3rj"], ["source_type", "reddit_LocalLLaMA"], ["score", 8], ["comment_count", 1], ["created_at", "2025-09-10 15:06:42.295963"], ["updated_at", "2025-09-10 15:06:42.295963"]]
