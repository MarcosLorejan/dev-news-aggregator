---

## Summary
Complete the CI/CD pipeline by adding automated deployment and local development tooling.

## Current Status âœ…
- [x] Fixed bundler caching issues in GitHub Actions
- [x] Added comprehensive test coverage reporting with SimpleCov
- [x] Fixed security vulnerabilities (Brakeman warnings)
- [x] Enhanced Dependabot configuration with grouping and Docker monitoring
- [x] Improved CI workflow with job dependencies and quality gates

## Remaining Tasks

### ðŸš€ Deployment Automation
- [ ] Set up Kamal-based CD workflow for automated deployments
- [ ] Configure container registry (Docker Hub, GHCR, etc.)
- [ ] Set up staging and production environments
- [ ] Add deployment secrets management
- [ ] Configure zero-downtime deployments

### ðŸ”§ Pre-commit Hooks  
- [ ] Install and configure pre-commit hooks
- [ ] Add RuboCop linting check before commits
- [ ] Add test execution before commits (optional, for speed)
- [ ] Add commit message validation
- [ ] Document setup process for team members

### ðŸ“Š Additional Quality Gates
- [ ] Add performance testing integration
- [ ] Set up automated security scanning (bundle audit)
- [ ] Add code complexity analysis
- [ ] Configure notification systems for deployment status

## Implementation Details

### Deployment Setup Requirements
When ready to implement, we'll need:

1. **Container Registry Configuration**
   - Registry choice (ghcr.io, Docker Hub, etc.)
   - Image naming convention
   - Authentication tokens as GitHub secrets

2. **Server Configuration**
   - Target domain/host(s) for deployment
   - SSH access configuration
   - Environment-specific secrets (RAILS_MASTER_KEY, etc.)

3. **Workflow Triggers**
   - Auto-deploy on main branch
   - Optional staging environment for feature branches
   - Manual deployment triggers

### Pre-commit Hooks Setup
- Use Overcommit or native Git hooks
- Fast feedback loop for developers
- Configurable severity levels
- Team onboarding documentation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Deployment workflow successfully deploys to staging/production
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks prevent bad commits from being pushed
- [ ] Documentation updated for team setup
- [ ] All secrets properly configured and secured
- [ ] Rollback procedures documented and tested

## Priority
- **Deployment Automation**: Medium (can be done when ready to deploy)
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Low (nice-to-have for developer experience)

## Related Files
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (current CI configuration)
- `config/deploy.yml` (Kamal configuration)
- `Gemfile` (dependency management)

**Note**: This issue tracks future enhancements. The current CI/CD pipeline is fully functional and addresses the immediate bundler caching issues that were causing build failures.
